<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>


<p>At one time it was thought possible for the
present work to be undertaken conjointly by the
Rev. M. C. F. Morris, author of <cite>Yorkshire Folk-Talk</cite>,
and myself. Such collaboration, though pleasing to
both, was found to be quite impracticable. Many
of my patrons and friends having urged me to undertake
the work single-handed, I have ventured to do
so. I have aimed at no higher standard than the
chatty style which I have adopted in drawing-rooms
and on the platform. If friends and critics prove
but half as kind and considerate in this new venture
as they have hitherto done, I have little to fear.
My main object has been simply to place on record,
in, I hope, a readable form, some of the wit, character,
customs, and folklore of the North Riding
which I have thought to be sufficiently interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
and worthy of being saved from that long list of
things forgotten.</p>

<p>The chapter on some characteristic sayings of
both the North and East Ridings, kindly contributed
by the Rev. M. C. F. Morris, will add greatly to the
value and interest of the work. I may here mention
that he is in no way answerable for any other
single sentence throughout the work. I feel it to
be my duty to make this quite clear, for, as a
humorist, I have ventured to include certain items
which the reverend gentleman most probably would
have run his pen through, had either the MS. or
proof-sheets passed through his hands.</p>

<p>The Glossary, though far from containing all the
words of our North Riding folk-speech, is as complete
as it has been possible for me to make it.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Mr. Atkinson and to
Mr. Morris, whose glossaries I have frequently consulted,
and in no less a degree to my friend
Dr. Johnson of Lancaster for his MS. notes, so
generously lent me.</p>

<p>I have done my best, and if my literary repast is
not set before my readers with the usual glitter of
silver and cut glass, I would humbly remind them
that the fare has been fairly stalked and prepared with
all due care as to accuracy, and cooked and served<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
with the best of everything my literary kitchen
possesses.</p>

<p>Many stories illustrative of Yorkshire character
and humour are given, mostly gathered from original
sources covering a period of many years, and in the
main are true. None of them, I believe, have hitherto
been published, and very few contained in these pages
have I given publicly.</p>

<p>The stories afford numerous examples of the
idiom and dialect as spoken in the North Riding, but
mainly (as to dialect) in that of Cleveland. The
reason for specializing that district is given elsewhere.</p>

<p>To the scores of happy hours spent with both old
and young by their own firesides, I owe the contents
of this book. Nearly all it contains they have given
me: to them I return my warmest thanks.</p>

<p>One other word—should a copy of this work find
its way into other lands, and be read by any of my
Yorkshire colonial cousins, to them I sincerely
offer the grip of friendship. And should any of our
Yorkshire words have gained a footing on other soil,
I shall be grateful for a list of the same.</p>

<p>To many of my subscribers I owe a lasting debt
of gratitude for that kindness and cordiality which
at once made me one of their house party when
staying with them as Society Humorist, and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
for the kind letters of encouragement they were so
good as to send me in the early stage of my work,
and to one and all I now offer my most sincere thanks
for their cordial replies in answer to my circular.</p>

<p>In conclusion, should this work bring conviction
that the Riding ought to have a Folklore and
Dialectical Society identified with itself, I shall not
have written in vain, and it would have my hearty
if humble support. No time should be lost. Bear
in mind, each aged person who passes from amongst
us is another valuable volume removed from the
shelves of an ever-decreasing library. I shall be
glad to receive the names of any of my readers
willing to help me in forming a North Riding
Folklore and Dialectical Society.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>YORKSHIRE STORIES OF WIT AND CHARACTER.</small></h2>


<p>‘Eddication an’ self-binnders is gahin ti to’n
t’ wo’lld upsahd doon,’ said an honest Yorkshireman
to me the other day. ‘Are things in general really
much different now from what they were, say, fifty
years ago?’ I asked. To which I received this
laconic reply, ‘Nowt’s t’ saam<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>.’ Nothing could
have been more forcible: the words meant much, and
the tone in which they were uttered meant even more.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this ‘tone,’ which is the very soul of
the dialect, can never be rendered in print. How
poor and meaningless in the mouth of a stranger
sound the words, ‘Cu’ thi waays, honey,’ but from the
lips of a Yorkshire mother to her bairn they carry
with them the sound of tenderest love and solicitude.
They ring with music, but it is music which is only
tuneful to the Yorkshire ear.</p>

<p>But to return to our friend. Now, though he said
‘Nowt’s t’ saam’ in somewhat a depreciatory manner,
he was fully aware of the value of education and the
utility of the various mechanical appliances which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
have of late years revolutionized agricultural labour.
There is a species, shall I say of conservatism? deeply
ingrafted in the Yorkshireman’s character. It is
a natural cautiousness which ever keeps this conservatism
to the forefront in everything connected with his
daily life. He does not, nor ever has, taken kindly
to novelties. He views with suspicion all things
which he considers innovations, i.e. which have
a tendency to alter the general rut in which his
father travelled before him. To him the old way is
good, and he is loth to leave it. No matter whether
it be temporal or spiritual, he hangs on long and hard
to the old and beaten track. <i lang="la">Errare est humanum</i>
fully applies to the Yorkshireman; he makes mistakes,
but never owing to his having been too precipitate.
He is naturally cautious and eminently practical.
‘Ah leyke ti ken hoo tweea an’ tweea’s gahin ti mak
fowr, an’ ’at fowr penn’oth o’ stuff’s wo’th fow’pence,
afoor Ah ware mah brass on owt,’ said an old Tyke
one day. This caution and practical turn in our
character, and which is carried into all things,
naturally leads those who are strangers to form the
opinion that we are dull and slow of comprehension,
but to those who can read between the lines this
verdict is very speedily reversed; for should it be
necessary to <em>spend</em> only words, ‘which costs nowt,
bud deean’t want wasting foor all that,’ then it will
be readily conceded that the Yorkshireman’s brain
can grasp a question and turn on steam so as to give
an answer as quickly and as much to the point as the
best of them.</p>

<p>It may not be couched in the politest of language;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
nay, most likely it will be very plain-spoken, even to
bluntness; but it will be just what the speaker thinks,
devoid of all the silken trimmings of conventionalism.</p>

<p>Many of the answers given to inquisitive questioners
often seem irrelevant; they need as it were some
sidelight to point the application, and generally it is
necessary one should have a considerable knowledge
of the dialect and idiom before its terseness can be
fully appreciated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when properly approached our people
are communicative, and express their opinion freely
and always <i lang="la">ad rem</i>.</p>

<p>But once having weighed any matter over, the
opinion so formed is, as it were, engraved on a rock of
adamant. Perhaps one or two illustrations will show
the different phases of character referred to in a clearer
light than pages of written explanation.</p>

<p>The new vicar (not a Yorkshireman) of a country
parish decided that his congregation should stand up
when he and the choir processed from the vestry.
‘Tha’ll nut deea ’t,’ said the churchwarden when the
question was mooted; ‘t’ au’d fau’k nivver did seea,
an’ t’ young uns weean’t.’ The tone in which this was
uttered would have been conclusive to any Yorkshireman.</p>

<p>‘I think I can make them,’ said the vicar. ‘Mak
’em!’ with great unction; ‘did ya saay mak ’em? Noo
ya mebbe mud ’tice ’em—yan nivver knaws what’ll
happen—bud Ah’s mairna sartin sewer ’at ya’ll
nivver mak ’em; an’ tha’ll tak a gay bit o’ ‘ticing, if
Ah knaw owt.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, leave it to me, I’ll manage it,’ said the vicar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
confidently. ‘Whya noo, gan on wi’ ya; bud deean’t
forgit ’at a hoss sumtahms tumm’ls ower t’ raal ’at it’s
loup’d afoor,’ was the parting advice of the worthy
churchwarden.</p>

<p>The following Sunday evening the vicar told his
congregation that he wished them to stand as the
choir came from the vestry, but next Sunday
morning found his congregation stolidly seated as
heretofore.</p>

<p>‘Ah tell’d ya tha wadn’t deea ’t,’ chuckled the
churchwarden.</p>

<p>‘But they will,’ replied the vicar. ‘Bud tha
weean’t,’ put in the churchwarden; and then he added
as a clincher, ‘Acoz tha’ve made up tha mahnds
aboot it, an’ ya weean’t shift ’em when yance tha’ve
deean that.’</p>

<p>‘You wait until evening,’ said the vicar, ‘and I shall
make them stand.’ And he did. Coming to the doorway
of the vestry, he gave out the hymn, the organ
commenced to play, up rose the congregation, and
out marched the choir and vicar.</p>

<p>‘Ah’ll watch him fra deeaing that onny mair,’
muttered one old dame loud enough for half the
church to hear.</p>

<p>‘Did I not say they would rise? And I’ll do that
every Sunday,’ said the vicar, as he and the warden
walked home.</p>

<p>‘Whya, Ah deean’t knaw saa mich aboot that.
It’s nut awlus seeaf ti ride wiv a curb an’ spurs.
Ya’ll ’a’e ti tak care noo; wa deean’t tak kindly
ti being tricked, Ah can tell ya; bud wa s’ see at
eftther.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>Next Sunday morning out stepped the vicar, gave
out the hymn, and then waited in the vestry until
the organ and congregation were in full swing; then,
and not until then, did he and the choir march out,
and to his no little surprise he found the whole
congregation lustily singing, but seated to a man.</p>

<p>As an example of their plain-speaking, as well as
their objection to fall in with a new order of things,
perhaps the following is fairly to the point.</p>

<p>The wife of the Vicar of ——, having engaged a new
maid, concluded various instructions by saying, ‘Should
any ladies call during the afternoon, and I ring, you
must bring in the small tea-tray and a kettle of
boiling water.’ The first two days passed over without
a hitch, but when the bell rang on the third
afternoon, instead of tea-tray and kettle a head
was thrust through the half-open door, and Mary
said, ‘Here Ah saay, cum ootsahd; Ah want ya a
minit.’ On the hostess retiring, Mary was heard to say,
‘Noo then! is this new-fengled gahin-on gahin ti
happen ivvery daay? Baith them an’ yow owt ti knaw
’at it’s maist in<em>con</em>venient leeaving yan’s reg’lar wark
ti mak tea at this tahm o’ t’ daay. Ya’ll ’a’e ti gan
back an’ saay ’at wa s’aan’t be yabble ti mannish
owt for ’em this efttherneean; Ah’s up ti t’ elbows
i’ muck.’</p>

<p>The Archdeacon of —— gave me the following
story, which is too good to hide its head. The bishop
had been preaching a restoration sermon in one
of our villages. After the sermon his lordship
and the archdeacon overtook the village blacksmith,
a well-known character. ‘Well, John, and how have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
you enjoyed the sermon?’ inquired the archdeacon.
‘Whya, nowt bud weel. Ah s’u’d think, sir’ (turning
to the bishop), ‘wiv a bit mair practis ya’ll mannish
cannily. I’ t’ main what ya sed war varra good;
a larl bit ti low i’ t’ voice for me, bud ya’ll mend
o’ that. Noo, Ah yance did hear a young chap, an’
he war nobbut a young un an’ all. Ah think ’at he
war iv a grosser’s shop, bud Ah’s nut sartin; bud
that’s nowt. He yance preeached i’ t’ Methody
chapel, an’ theer’s nut a wo’d of a lee aboot it, what
Ah saay is trew; ya c’u’d hear him slap t’ Bahble
an’ shoot hauf t’ waay doon t’ village. Aye, ya c’u’d
stan’ ootsahd an’ smeeak ya’re pipe an’ get all t’ good
fra what he war saaying; <em>bud, then, he war a
preeacher</em>.’ I can well imagine the tone that last
‘bud, then, he war a preeacher’ would be uttered in.</p>

<p>The younger fry are just as open as the older folk.
I remember a lady telling me she had called at a farm-house.
Evidently she had been seen approaching.
It would seem the doll and other litter of the wee
daughter had been quickly bundled out of sight, and
all things, as far as possible, put in order. For the
moment the amusement of the little one was put an
end to, and this did not escape the notice of the
child. She, Yorkshire-like, formed her own opinion
upon the proceeding, and only waited for a suitable
moment to very plainly express the same. Resting
her elbows on the lady’s knees, with her chubby little
face in her hands, she said, when a lull in the conversation
gave her a chance to speak, ‘Ah saay,
missus, hoo pleasant it wad ’a’e been if you’d nivver
’a’e cum’d.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>The cautiousness of the Yorkshireman is so evident
in all matters, it is so pronounced, that to give
examples is almost to lay oneself open to the charge
‘ov telling a chap summat he knaws.’ Nevertheless
I give you one, not so much because it is exactly
Q.E.D., but because it is one of the best expositions
of Socialism I have ever heard. It seems that some
Socialist won one man over to his views, and this
man met a friend of his. ‘Whya, noo then,’ began the
friend; ‘what tha tell ma ’at thoo’s to’n’d ti be a
Socialist, is ’t reet?’ ‘Aye, it’s reet; an’ it’s a gran’
thing an’ all. Thoo owt ti join uz.’ ‘Owt Ah? What
is ’t ’at ya’re efter?’ ‘Whya, thoo knaws it’s lyke this;
ther’s a lot o’ fau’k living i’ gert hooses, an’ tha’re
eating an’ drinking all t’ daay lang an’ guzzling t’
neet thruff, sum on ’em, an’ it’s gahin ti be stopped.
Ivverything’s gahin ti be shared up, an’ all on uz
get what’s wer awn; neeabody nowt na mair ’an
onnybody else, dizn’t ta see,’ ‘Whya, nut fur sartin.’
said his friend. ‘Diz ta meean ’at thoo’ll share up an’
all?’ ‘Aye, ivverybody will.’ ‘What, is’t gahin ti be
a soart o’ brotherly luv’? Ivverybody wi’ nowt neea
mair na onnybody else.’ ‘Aye, that’s it; brotherly
luv’. Ivverybody all t’ seeam, neeabody nowt neea
different neeawaays ti neeabody i’ neea road.’ ‘It
soonds grand; bud diz ta meean ti saay if thoo ’ed
tweea hosses an’ Ah ’edn’t a hoss ’at thoo’d gi’e ma
yan?’ ‘Iv a minit Ah wad. If Ah’d tweea an’ thoo
’edn’t yan Ah s’u’d gi’e tha yan leyke all that,’ said he,
slapping his friend on the back. ‘Aye, an’ if ta ’ed
tweea coos, an’ Ah wanted a coo, wad ta gi’e uz
a coo?’ ‘Just t’ seeam. If thoo ’edn’t a coo, an’ Ah ’ed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
tweea, Ah s’u’d tell tha ti tak yan awaay wi tha. Noo
thoo understands what wa’re efter.’ ‘An’ if thoo’d
tweea pigs, an’ Ah ’edn’t a pig, an’ Ah ass’d tha fur
a pig, wad ta gi’e ma yan?’ ‘Naay noo,’ said the
Socialist; ‘thoo’s cumin’ teea clooase hand noo; thoo
knaws ’at Ah ’ev tweea pigs.’</p>

<p>Possibly not a little surprised was the angler who,
when fishing in one of the small streams of the upper
reaches of the Ure, said jokingly to an old chap who
had been watching his vain attempts to land several
fish, ‘I think I need a hanger on; what do you
say?’ The old chap had been thoroughly disgusted
with the way in which the fish had been played.
It was no case for joking; it was a downright sin
for such a man to be allowed to fish. So the answer,
as may be expected, was more to the point than
polite. ‘What thoo wants,’ said the old chap with
a grunt of disgust, ‘is nut a hinger on, bud a flinger
oot. If it’s fish ’at thoo’s efter, thoo’ll ’a’e ti lig t’
rod doon an’ set ti wark wi t’ net; thoo mebbins mud
’a’e t’ luck ti catch yan o’ them ’at thoo’s hauf killed.
Thoo’s naa fisher; thoo’s nowt bud a spoil watter,
that’s what thoo is.’ Thus relieving himself, Old
Willie walked away.</p>

<p>One of my sketches, given at a Primrose League
meeting, gave great offence to the coachman of a noble
lord. Entertainers, by the way, do not hold any social
position in the eyes of such. Some time afterwards
I was asked to go as entertaining guest on his
lordship’s son’s attaining his majority. A day or two
before my arrival my host asked his coachman if he
had not been to the entertainment which I had given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>‘Aye,’ said the old chap, ‘bud I wadn’t gan agaan.
He’s up ti nowt, isn’t yon youth; he’ll nivver git on.
He’s gitten impedence foor owt, he spares nowt na
neeabody, he taks sarvants an’ t’ quality off all alike;
Ah reckon nowt on him at all.’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry to hear that,’ said his master.</p>

<p>‘Whya, Ah’s seear ya’ve gitten neea call ti be, he’s nut
wo’th it. Ya mun excuse me, my lord, bud what mud
ya be sorry foor?’ ‘Well, because he is coming here.’
‘Cumin’ here!’ said the coachman, amazed; ‘what
ivver foor?’ ‘To entertain my guests.’ ‘What! deea
ya meean when t’ young lord cums at age?’ he asked,
his amazement increasing. ‘Yes,’ said his lordship,
greatly amused. ‘Oha! an’ wheer will ya put him up?
’coz Ah can tell ya ’at t’ sarvants weean’t want ti ’ev
him amangst them, tha neeawaays setten up wiv him.’
‘But he won’t be with the servants.’ ‘Then wheer
will he be?’ ‘With us, of course.’ ‘Deea ya meean ti
saay ’at he’ll dine wi’ yow an’ t’ quality?’ asked the old
chap, fairly amazed now. ‘Certainly.’ For a moment
the old fellow hesitated; he was bewildered by such a
piece of folly. And then he spoke his mind. ‘Well!’
he gasped, ‘ya mun excuse me, my lord, bud Ah think
’at yer gahin ti mak a varra common do on ’t.’ Nice
for me, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>However boorish and brusque strangers may dub us,
it is admitted on all hands that the Yorkshireman is
fairly ’cute: he always has an eye to the main chance.
And although others who are glibber of tongue may
to a certain extent fairly ’mazzle’ him with their verbosity,
yet any such may certainly claim to having
done the ’hat trick’ if in the end they manage to out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>wit
the Tyke. ‘He ommaist ’wildered ma wiv his
slather, bud Ah pairted wi’ nowt,’ said an old man
who had been tackled by a book agent.</p>

<p>‘Did ta bet owt at t’ races?’ asked one Tyke of
another. ‘Neea, Ah didn’t. It war leyke this, thoo
knaws. T’ chaps ’at Ah seed stanning o’ t’ top o’ steeals
an’ sitting unner gert um’erellas all seeam’d ti ’ev gawd
rings an’ cheeans on, an’ tha war varra weel dhriss’d an’
all, whahl monny ov ’em ’at war ’livering ther brass up
war oot at t’ teeas an’ doon at t’ heels. Seea Ah sed tiv
mysen, “T’ steeal an’ t’ um’erella chaps leeak ez if tha
war ’evving t’ best o’ t’ bargain all t’ waay thruff,’ an’
seea neean on ’em gat onny o’ mah brass. Dizn’t ta
think ’at Ah war i’ t’ reet on ’t?”</p>

<p>Cautiousness and ’cuteness is fairly well set forth in
the following story. Old Jobson wished to gain some
legal information, ‘bud he didn’t want ti pay owt for
’t.’ Meeting the legal light one day, he began, ‘Ah
saay, if Ah wor ti ax ya summat aboot summat, s’u’d
Ah ’a’e ti pay summat? It’s aboot yon pathwaay o’
mahn ’at Ah want ti knaw summat.’ ‘Certainly; I
don’t give advice free,’ replied the lawyer. ‘Whya then,
Ah weean’t ax ya nowt; things may bahd ez they are,
whahl yow want a larl piece o’ knowledge fra me, an’
then wa’ll see if wa caan’t mak a swap on’t. Nowther
t’ field na t’ path’ll shift,’ said Jobson as he walked
away. And so matters rested for some months, in
fact until the lawyer’s horse (a very valuable one) was
suddenly taken ill. Jobson was at once sent for, he
being an expert in all horse ailments. The old farmer,
after a careful examination of his patient, declared he
knew what was amiss and what was needed to effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
a cure. ‘Then I will send my man for what you need
at once,’ said the owner.</p>

<p>‘Aye, bud wait a bit; deean’t ya aim ’at tahm’s
cum’d when wa s’all ’a’e ti swap wer knowledge?’ said
the farmer, with a twinkle in his eye. The solicitor
burst out laughing; he saw the joke and admitted the
validity of the claim. The old chap saved the horse,
and the pathway was satisfactorily arranged.</p>

<p>The Yorkshireman always sees that he gets value
for his money, at least he always tries to do so.</p>

<p>The village orchestral society were rehearsing for
a public performance which was to be given the
following week. The squire and a musical friend
had just dropped in towards its conclusion. The
friend, speaking at the conclusion with the conductor,
said, ‘You have a remarkably good band; you only
lack one slight addition to make it one of the best
for the size of your village I have ever listened to.
Will you allow me to suggest that you get a horn?
you lack only that.’ ‘Oha, an’ what’s a horn?’
inquired the conductor. Having had the matter
fully explained, he asked what a horn could be
bought for. But the gentleman pointed out there
was hardly time to procure a horn and teach a man
how to play it before the entertainment came off.
‘Whya then,’ asked the conductor, ‘deea yer knaw
a chap ’at c’u’d cum an’ play t’ horn foor uz, an’
what wad he cum foor?’ ‘I know a first-class
player, and I think he would come for five pounds.’
‘Fahve pund!’ gasped the conductor. ‘Whya, Ah c’u’d
git a whoale band foor that!’ ‘Never mind the money,
John,’ said the squire; ‘I’ll see about that.’ ‘Oha,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
whya, if it’s gahin ti be leyke that, let’s ’a’e t’ chap
wi’ t’ horn.’ And so the matter was settled. On
the night of the performance the man with the horn
put in an appearance, and all went well for
about ten minutes, when the conductor stopped the
band, and turning to the horn-player, he said, ‘Noo
then, thee wi’ t’ horn, thoo isn’t playing.’ ‘No,’ said
he; ‘I have forty-five bars rest here.’ Whereupon the
conductor electrified every one by saying, ‘Mebbe thoo
thinks seea, bud leeaks ta here, wa’ve paid thee fahve
pund foor t’ neet an’ thoo’ll ’a’e ti puff all t’ waay
thruff.’</p>

<p>Scores of stories could be given illustrating the
aptitude our country-people exhibit in extricating
themselves when placed in an awkward corner.</p>

<p>The dear old lady who was my study for
Mrs. Waddleton asked me to paint her a picture—‘seea
ez Ah s’all ’a’e summat ti leeak at ’at ya’ve
deean yersel when ya’ve geean,’ said she. I readily
promised to do so, and in due course sent her a
little snow scene.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards she saw me passing. ‘Noo
then,’ she shouted, ‘cum in wi’ ya. Ah’ve gitten ’t
heng’d up, an’, mah wo’d, bud it leeaks grand, dizn’t
it?’ ‘I am glad you like it,’ said I, as I gazed at
my work of art nestling amongst coloured grasses
and peacock feathers; ‘and very nicely you have
arranged everything. But perhaps it would be
better if you hung it the right way up.’ Her face
was a picture. The dear old soul felt that she had
blundered; she was fearful lest I should feel hurt.</p>

<p>But her native wit saved her. ‘Wrang sahd up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
is ’t? Aa, bud, Ah saay, ya mun be a clivver penter
seea ez ti pent a picter ’at leeaks reet onny road
up.’ Then, after a moment’s consideration, she added,
‘But mebbies Ah’d best to’n ’t t’other road roond;
sum fau’k mud think ’at yan didn’t knaw t’ reet end
ov a picter if yan let it bahd ez ’tis.’</p>

<p>Sir C—— and Mr. W——, a solicitor, once
overtook Abe Braithwaite, a well-known character
in Bedale, on the way to the meet. ‘Good morning,’
said Sir C——; ‘shall we have a find, Abe?’ ‘Nut
i’ yon cover; bud Ah cud gi’e ya a wrinkle.’ ‘Well,
let’s have it,’ said Sir C——. ‘Whya, deean’t weeast
mich tahm yonder, bud gan ti t’ far cover, an’ ya’ll
finnd yan theer, hard eneeaf.’ ‘All right, Abe, I’ll
bear in mind what you say,’ said Sir C—— as the
two rode off. ‘Ah saay,’ shouted Abe after the
retreating horsemen, ‘if ya’d ass’d advice frev him
’at’s wi’ ya he’d wanted six an’ eightpence, bud
Ah nivver charge nowt na mair ’an a bob mysen.’
And he got it.</p>

<p>A story just strikes me which illustrates several
points already mentioned. A young fellow who was
supposed to be learning land agency bought a horse
at an adjacent fair, and was most systematically
swindled. The said horse was being looked over
by one of the village Tykes. Now for many reasons
the fellow did not wish to offend the purchaser, but
it was really impossible to say one thing in its
favour. ‘Well, Tom, what is the verdict?’ asked
the embryo agent. And then came the answer, which
was worthy of a Grecian lawyer: ‘Whya noo, that
gertly depends. Ya weean’t ’a’e bowt it owther ti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
show or hunt, noo ’a’e ya?’ ‘Oh no, just to knock
about on.’ ‘Oha, whya then, ’t’ll deea grandly ti
knock aboot on,’ said Tom. ‘All the same you
think they’ve swindled me, now don’t you?’ ‘Whya
it’s mebbins mair ’an Ah’d ’a’e gi’en for ’t mysen,
but ’t’ll deea grandly ti knock aboot on.’ At this
juncture they were joined by the village ostler, one
who was never over-nice in his remarks. ‘Now,
Jack, what do you think of my bargain?’ ‘What
div Ah think on ’t? Whya, Ah wadn’t be seen
takking it ti t’ kennels’ (i. e. taking it to feed the dogs);
and then, thinking he had been a little too severe,
he added, ‘Bud Ah’ll tell ya what, ’t’ll deea foor yer
ti larn what a hoss s’u’d be, foor it’s getten neean o’
t’ points ’at a hoss owt ti ’ev, an’ ommaist ivvery yan
’at it s’u’dn’t; ’t’ll deea foor yer ti study ’t up.’</p>

<p>The Tyke has a habit of answering you in a kind of
metaphor, which, as before remarked, is almost unintelligible
unless something of dialect and idiom has
been mastered. As a case in point, I remember
after the last general election saying to an old fellow,
‘Now, John! what do you think of this complete
change in the country?’ Now, John did not know
which side I favoured, neither did he wish me to learn
for which party he had voted, and, further, he was
determined not to say anything which would either
give offence to me or expose his own hand. The
question for a moment was a difficult one to answer,
but the answer came pat enough: ‘Whya, Parliment’s
varra mich leyke t’ land—ya mun chaange t’ crops
noos an’ agaan, or it’s ti neea good. Ah s’ ‘a’e ti be
gahin noo; good daay ti ya.’ He had answered me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
fully answered me. He had let nothing escape him.
I was none the wiser as to what his own opinions were,
and I might just as well have saved myself the trouble
of asking.</p>

<p>The inspectors of our Board schools can recount many
true and curious anecdotes of our country scholars; but
it should be borne in mind by the department that,
although the Yorkshire country-people and their bairns
are bilingual, it is only their mother tongue and
ordinary English which up to the present they have
mastered. The southern twang, pronunciation, and
slang is to them as a mystic rune. North-country men,
if you please, to examine North-country boys and girls.
Very often the questions, as put by South-country
inspectors, might just as well be asked in Sanskrit, and
very naturally they remain unanswered, whilst the
class is voted as hopeless dunces, when the fault really
lies at the door of the questioner. At one school in
Wensleydale a South-country inspector, when examining
a class on the Bible, put this question, ‘Neow tell
me something abeout Mouses.’ ‘Cats kill ’em,’ was the
prompt reply. Another one said to a promising
standard in mental arithmetic, ‘Three packets of pins at
a penny each, five hanks of tape penny each, nine reels
of thread penny each, five boxes of hair-pins penny
each, and six ounces of worsted at three halfpence
per ounce. How much does the parcel come to?
Quick!’ But the speed with which the question had
been asked, the twang, and the unfamiliar sound of
many of the words, left the standard almost in absolute
ignorance of the question. One thing, and of only
one thing, were they clear upon—that they were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
asked something about <em>thread</em>, <em>worsted</em>, and <em>hair-pins</em>.
But as the inspector uttered that ‘Quick!’ he fixed his
eyes on one lad, and the effect of that glance was
mesmeric. The lad immediately answered, ‘Pleease,
sur, wa ar’n’t lasses.’</p>

<p>But it is not the South-country man alone who
receives unlooked for answers from the practical
bairns of our dales. After a somewhat lengthy
and highflown picture-painting on faith, the teacher,
wishing to see if the children had grasped her foolish
poetical outburst, said to one of the boys, whose
mother, by the way, was a widow and desperately
poor, ‘Now, Tommy, if I were to say to you, “There
will be a rich plum pudding for your dinner,” and
you believed me, what would that be?’ ‘It ’ud
be a gert tak in, for wa nivver ’a’e nowt na better
’an a suet dumpling at oor hoos,’ was the unexpected
reply.</p>

<p>Again, an inspector asked one of the boys in Bilsdale,
or rather commenced to ask, a question in mental
arithmetic: said he, ‘If you had in your hand five
apples, two oranges, and three pears, and I was to
take—-— ’ But he got no further; the practical bairn
stopped him by saying, ‘Pleease, sur, Ah c’u’dn’t ho’d
’em all i’ yah han’.’</p>

<p>To conclude this chapter, just one more example.
Said an inspector to a little girl, ‘If I knitted twelve
stitches in a minute, how many stitches should I have
on my needle at the end of five minutes?’ ‘Ya wadn’t
a’e neean, ’coz ya deean’t knit stitches; ya’re nut
gahin ti catch me i’ that waay.’ He ought to have
said ’loops.’</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>WIT AND CHARACTER</small></h2>


<p>Our country-people possess in a very marked
degree the faculty of explaining away anything which
for special reasons they do not care to admit. Very
often they do this in a marvellously subtle way.
Sometimes so fine is the point upon which they turn
an argument, that that which was to be demonstrated
is entirely lost sight of, whilst new issues are introduced
in such a seemingly natural way that in the
end you find yourself contending for some point in
which you have no earthly interest, and which has
no connexion with the original argument, but which,
owing to this strategical shifting, has put them on
sure ground, leaving you at a hopeless disadvantage.
Equally conspicuous is their pride and independency;
no matter how poor they may be they strongly
object to being patronized.</p>

<p>‘Ah weean’t let onnybody clap me on t’ back. Ah
paay fer what Ah git, an’ that’s good eneeaf; he’s
nowt na better ’an what Ah is,’ said a man one day,
who had been spoken to, with the kindest intention,
but in that unfortunate way which some of the best-intentioned
people have of being familiar, but faintly
colouring the same with just a slight whiff of patronizing
superiority. And the Yorkshireman won’t stand it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Don’t misunderstand me: although no respecter of
person he is quite willing to pay deference to those
whom he considers his superiors and who are worthy
of it; but he is the one who acts as judge in such
a case. If you are a stranger, you will have to earn
this deference by good behaviour on your part, or it
is quite possible, if you act otherwise, you will be
the recipient of some very plain Yorkshire, whether
you understand it or not. And also bear in mind the
Tyke is always equal to giving an answer, and in his
own peculiar way very smart at repartee.</p>

<p>A good example of one of the peculiarities
mentioned is made evident in the following story.
Master and man were returning from a coursing
match, at which the master’s dog had been badly
beaten. The man knew it was a great disappointment,
and as a faithful servant he felt keenly the
adverse result of the day’s outing. ‘I felt sure our
dog would win,’ said the master, and then waited for his
man to reply. Now, Tom would not say how much
inferior their dog really was to the winner; in fact,
he would only admit that to himself. So he held
his peace. A moment later the master tackled him
again, and this time with a question direct. ‘You
saw the course, Tom; how do you account for it?’
‘Whya, sur,’ began Tom, ‘dogs is queer things, an’
hares is queer things; in fact, theer’s nowt na queerer
’an what hares offen is. Noo, they’re varra flighty
things is hares, an’ Ah’ve offens thowt ’at sumtahms

<p>Years ago, when guides showed tourists and others
round Fountains Abbey, giving at the same time their
version of the history of the ruins—much of which
it must be said was the outcome of their own imagination,
and, though deeply interesting, was opposed to
all the canons of archaeology—several members
of the Royal Archaeological Society and a party of
ladies and gentlemen were relegated to the care of
‘Scott,’ an old guide and a well-known Yorkshire
character of those days. As they went through the
ruins the old fellow gave his version, only a moment
afterwards to hear quite a different explanation given
by some member of the R.A.S. At last Scott could
‘bahd it na langer.’ ‘Ah saay,’ questioned he, ‘war
you here when t’ Abbey war built?’ ‘No, neither
were you, my friend,’ replied the gentleman. ‘Mebbe
nut, bud Ah’ve been here a seet langer ’an what
you ’ev, for all that; sum fau’k think tha knaw sa
mich,’ he was heard to mutter. By-and-by the round
was completed, and then it was that old Scott fired
off his last shot. ‘Noo then,’ said he, ‘cum on all
t’ lot on ya, an’ Ah’ll tak ya ti summat ’at neean on
ya can owther gainsaay or alter; noo then, cum on,’
and he marched them under the echo. ‘Noo then,
gentlemen, ya can’t dispute owt ’at’s sed here; gan
on, sum on ya, shoot summat.’ One of the party,
who had already had more than one wordy battle
with the old fellow, shouted, ‘Any one seen an
old fool knocking about this morning?’ At which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
there was a general laugh. But before the repeat
had died away, the old fellow shouted in a voice which
made the echo ring again, ‘Neea, bud theear’s onny
amount o’ young uns under t’ echo.’ And I think
he scored.</p>

<p>Another good story: in fact many hail from
Great Ayton. When the Grange was being built,
artists and other workmen from town and elsewhere
were requisitioned to beautify the place. Many
of these travelled gentlemen, on their first arrival,
considered the Yattoners fair game for their sport
and wit, but very often they found out, when too
late to save themselves, that they had pressed the
wrong button. During their stay a small wild-beast
show opened on the green. In front of the monkeys’
cage stood a Yattoner, greatly amused with their
antics. ‘Admiring your relations?’ inquired one
of the foreign masons as he passed. ‘They’re neea
relations o’ mahn; neean ov oor family’s owt akin
ti yours,’ was the instant reply. ‘Why don’t you
wash your brains? there’s plenty of water in the beck,’
said another of the foreign fraternity. ‘Ther mebbins
is what ’ud wesh mahn, bud you’d ’a’e ti wait whahl
a fresh cam doon.’ ‘Go home,’ said another of
them, ‘and tell your father you are the biggest fool he
has ever seen.’ ‘He’d leather ma for telling a lee if
Ah did; ya’re forgitting ’at ya lodge wiv uz;’ and then
he dodged a lump of wood which came that way.</p>

<p>Old Bessy kept the village store, and in her way
was quite a character; so was her shop for the matter
of that. I never was in such a shop in my life. Anything,
everything, and all on the top of something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
else. In fact it was as one of the natives put it,
‘Owt ’at Bessy ’ezn’t ’s nut wo’th assing for.’ The
one big house in the place for a short time was rented
by a gentleman whose family made up for any deficiency
in pedigree by all-round rudeness to every one
with whom they came in contact. On one occasion
a daughter of the said house flounced into Bessy’s
shop and asked for something which it was most
unlikely would be kept in a shop of that kind. ‘Naay,’
said Bessy, ‘Ah ’a’en’t gitten nowt o’ that soart;
Ah deean’t knaw what t’ stuff is ya’re assing for.’
‘It is just useless my trying to buy anything in
a pottering little shop like this. You keep nothing
but a lot of old rubbish. You never have anything
I want,’ was the young lady’s rude reply. ‘Why noo,
Ah’ll tell ya what, t’ next tahm ’at Ah gan ti Ripon,
Ah’ll see if Ah can’t get a box o’ good behav’o’r; you
mun cum in then, an’ Ah’ll gi’e ya good weight, for ya
want it mair na onnybody else. Noo deean’t forgit
ti cum in,’ were the last words the young lady heard
as she hurried out.</p>

<p>His Honour Judge —- for some little time had
a house in a Cleveland village, and whilst there he
did a bit of ’hoss swapping’ with one of the farmers.
Unfortunately his Honour’s horse did not turn out
well. Meeting the farmer one day, he said, ‘Robert,
you took me in with that horse, it has turned out
very badly.’ ‘Hez ’t, noo? Whya, that’s a bad job;
bud you maun’t gan blethering aboot ’at Ah’ve ta’en
ya in, or else fau’k’ll get it i’ ther heeads ’at ya’re
nobbut a varra poor judge.’</p>

<p>Quite likely enough, if you get into conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
with the old people, they will give you their opinion
upon most things, and that too very often without
your asking for it. There will be no beating about
the bush, no attempt to smooth away rough corners;
the Yorkshireman detests putty and varnish. What
he has to say, like his hitting, comes straight from the
shoulder.</p>

<p>The hounds were in full cry. A lady and gentleman
on approaching a closed gate against which a farmer’s
man was leaning, the gentleman called out, ‘Hi there!
open the gate, look sharp!’ but the man stood stolidly
looking at the hounds. ‘Why don’t you open the gate,
you fool?’ shouted the horseman angrily. Turning
slowly round, the yokel said very quietly, ‘Ah deean’t
call ti mahnd ’at ivver Ah ’ed a God’s-penny fra you.
If ya’ll nobbut stan’ back Ah’ve na doot t’ lady’ll
show ya t’ road ower. Ah can see ’at ya’re a bit caff-hearted.’
Springing to the ground the horseman
found the gate was locked. ‘Why, it’s locked,’ said
he, turning to the lady. ‘Ah c’u’d ’a’e tell’d ya that
lang sin,’ said the yokel. ‘Well, I think you might
have done so,’ said the lady, kindly. ‘We have lost
a lot of time.’ ‘If you’d cum’d byv yersen, miss,
Ah’d ’a’e brokken t’ gate doon for ya. Bud yah feeal
losses his wits when he’s called yan byv another,’
was the compliment and retort all in one.</p>

<p>On another occasion, the horseman forgetting to
pay the usual toll, the gate-opener greatly amused
every one by saying, as he touched his cap, ‘Noo,
mebbe ya ’evn’t gitten neea small chaange on ya,
bud Ah’ll tell ya hoo wa can mannish ’t: Ah’ve gitten
nahnpence, if you’ve a bob?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>A good story is told by a Cleveland vicar. The
day on which he arrived in his new parish he had to
transact some little matter with the sexton. On
inquiry he was informed this worthy was to be found
in the far pasture. Thither he went, finding the old
man busy mowing. ‘Well, my man!’ began the
vicar. ‘Noo then,’ said Old Willie, going on with
his mowing. ‘I wish to have a word or two with
you,’ said the vicar, not very pleased with his off-hand
reception. He was not Yorkshire, and didn’t
understand their ways then.</p>

<p>‘All reet, gan on wi’ tha.’ This without stopping the
swing of his scythe.</p>

<p>‘I think you don’t know who I am. I am your
new vicar.’ Doubtless at the time the vicar imagined
the effect of this startling announcement would be
such that Old Willie’s scythe would fall from his
hands, and most abject apologies be poured forth. But
no, Willie just remarked, ‘Oh, are ya? Whya, ya
maun’t stan theer; ya’ll ’a’e ti shift yersen, or Ah s’all
mow yer legs off t’ next swathe Ah tak.’ And the
vicar moved.</p>

<p>Our country-people have a way of summing up
and giving a verdict quite on lines of their own. But
it must be borne in mind that what is taken in a
figurative sense by those of a wider experience, is
often accepted literally by those whose lives for the
most part have been bounded by their own homestead
and dale. When the last historical pageant was held
at Ripon, trips brought the dales-people from all
parts. And although I do not think any of them
went so far as to imagine the various characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
impersonated had been dug up and set in motion for
their amusement and edification, I am sure in the
main they were greatly mystified as to how they had
all been gathered together. On the last day, when
possibly fifteen thousand people were present, a group
of ladies and gentlemen were standing near the east
window of the Abbey—near by were two or three
monks conversing with several knights in chain
armour, and on their right stood King Charles
surrounded by the ladies of his court. A gentleman
standing hard by said to his lady companion, ‘It is
really a splendid spectacle, and gives one a perfect
picture of what it must have been in days past.’
‘You’ll excuse me, sir,’ said a dame who had overheard
his remark, ‘bud is this leyke what it used ti be?’
‘Yes, my good woman, exactly,’ the gentleman
answered. ‘Whya then, Ah can weel understan’ hoo
it war ’at tha pulled t’ pleeace doon’ (meaning the
Abbey), ‘for it’s a giddy gahin-on is this. Bud Ah
will saay,’ pointing to the ladies of King Charles’
Court, ‘’at Ah nivver seed a finer set o’ lasses i’ all
mah leyfe. An’ Ah’ve na doot ’at that accoonts for ’t.’</p>

<p>The last clause, I imagine, referred to the ruinous
state of the Abbey.</p>

<p>The same peculiar trait was fully exemplified during
an Art exhibition at York. Several of the pictures
were offered for sale, the price being given in the
catalogue. Whilst a couple were gazing in wonderment
at one picture, the woman was overheard to say,
‘Ah nivver thowt ’at fraams cost seea mich brass.
Sitha, mun, that yan’s ower a hunderd pund; it mun
be t’ fraam, thoo knaws, fer t’ picter’s nobbut hauf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
deean; t’ chap ’at’s pented it ’ezn’t ’ed tahm ti finish ’t,
fer neean on ’em’s gitten ther cleeas on.’</p>

<p>Some few years ago there was an excursion started
from Whitby <i lang="la">viâ</i> Battersby, its destination being
Wensleydale. Many who availed themselves of the
trip alighted at Aysgarth. One batch in charge of
the curate wended their way to the force, which
owing to recent rains was seen at its best. ‘By gum,’
said one, ‘bud ther’s a seet o’ watter cuming ower
yonder.’ ‘Ah’ll tell ya what,’ said another, giving
a huge wink, ‘they weean’t be yabble ti keep that gam
up lang; tha’ll be letting ’t all off afoor t’ tothers cum
up, if they deean’t mahnd.’ The curate was shocked;
his poetical soul was pained at such, as he imagined,
crass ignorance, so he endeavoured to lift them from out
of themselves. After quite a rhetorical outburst bearing
on the grandeur of the scene, he wound up with, ‘Is
it not marvellous, magnificent, overwhelming, to behold
it thundering, rumbling, tumbling over?’ Poetry of
that kind makes the speaker breathless, and he
paused. Then, turning to one of the party, he said,
‘What do you think, John, eh?’ ‘Aye, ya’re all reet
about its thunnering, tumm’ling, an’ rumm’ling, bud for
t’ leyfe o’ mah Ah deean’t see owt ’at ther is ti ho’d it
back,’ was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>I remember on one occasion, when being driven to
the station by a real old Yorkshire coachman—I had
been one of a house party for three days as society
humorist—the old fellow giving me a huge dig with
his elbows, and saying, ‘Ah saay, is yon all you deea
fer a living?’ ‘That is all,’ I replied. ‘Well, by goa!
bud ya git yer living easy, you deea.’ ‘I don’t know;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
if you had all the knocking about that I have perhaps
you would not think it quite so easy,’ said I.
‘Whya, Ah deean’t knaw; what ya’ll ’ev yer expenses
paid, ’evn’t ya?’ ‘Certainly,’ I answered. ‘Aye; an’
ya git fed fer nowt, deean’t ya?’ ‘Of course,’ I replied,
greatly amused. ‘Whya then,’ said he, ‘Ah’ll tell
ya what: ya travel fer nowt, yer sheltered fer nowt, fed
fer nowt, an’ ya deea nowt; Ah leeak upon ya ez
nowt i’ t’ wo’lld else bud a aristocratic pauper.’ ‘Wait
a moment,’ said I; ‘don’t you think brains count for
something in a matter of this kind?’ And then,
with that ineffable scorn which I think only the
Yorkshireman of that type can assume, he said,
‘Braans! braans!! braans!!! Ugh, Ah’ve ez monny
brains ez you ’ev if they war nobbut scraped oot.’</p>

<p>‘Which waay did ta vote?’ asked one. ‘Whya noo,
it war leyke this waay: Ah went an’ heeard all ’at
t’ blew chap ’ed ti saay, an’ he made it oot ez cleear
ez t’ neease on yer feeace ’at t’ yallers war up ti neea
good; an’ efter that Ah went ti lissen ti t’ yaller chap,
an’ he sed ’at t’ blews war warse ’an nowt at all. Seea
Ah thowt ti mysen, ’at if them ’at’s my betters dizn’t
knaw what’s what, it’s nut for sike o’ me ti saay; seea
when t’ voting daay cam Ah stopped at yam an’ sell’d
t’ pig.’</p>

<p>A classical curate was seized with an inordinate
yearning to improve and elevate the ’thought tone’ (I
quote his words) of certain Cleveland farmers. Now, as
a body of men, the Cleveland farmers, as I know them,
are about as shrewd, practical, and thoroughly business-like
as you will find anywhere in Yorkshire, and that
is saying a deal; still I am bound to admit, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
I know little of ’thought tone’ myself, they know less.
There is no money in it. Make it clear that an income of
two hundred a year can be squeezed out of ’thought
tone,’ and Yorkshire will supply the world with any
amount, in tins, condensed, and hermetically sealed.
At present it is not quoted on ’Change. But to my
story. The curate made a dead set at one farmer in
particular, giving him, on one occasion, a graphic
account of the siege of Troy. ‘One general, sir,’ said
he, ‘though sorely wounded, commanded his armour-bearer
to strap on his armour, and this having been
done he placed himself in the forefront of the battle’
(here much dramatic action and tone was indulged in
by the curate, and the hearth-rug greatly
disarranged)—‘in the forefront, sir, and single-handed he engaged
three of the Trojans’ (seizing the poker and swinging
it round his head). ‘He slew two of them, but the third
pierced him to the heart, and he sank lifeless upon his
vanquished foes. ‘Twas a brave deed, and a noble
death, the death of a hero. What do you think, sir?’
Breathless, and with dampened brow, he waited for an
outburst of tone, which he fully expected would rush
forth as waters from the burst bank of a reservoir. The
farmer just removed his pipe and placidly remarked,
‘Too bou’d, sir, too bou’d.’ The curate sank into a
chair aghast. Was the man human, or was he
beyond hope! ‘Is that all?’ he gasped; ‘has no
other thought struck you whilst I recounted my
story?’ ‘Whya,’ said the farmer, ‘Ah did yance ower
aim ’at ya’d be fetching t’ clock doon wi’ t’ poker,
bud fort’natly ya didn’t.’ The curate fled.</p>

<small>WIT AND CHARACTER—<i>continued</i>.</small></h2>


<p>Our country-people, as has been incidentally remarked,
are very proud and independent, but I venture
to say both their pride and independency are cast in
a right groove, and may certainly be classed amongst
the chief elements which have made the Yorkshireman
the self-reliant mortal which he certainly is. I have
already said that he is eminently practical, and I now
add hard to convince. Often, I admit, his mode of
arguing would puzzle a Philadelphian lawyer, but
after all it is argument, if you are only Yorkshire
scholar enough to understand his way of handling
a subject. The country-people are hard to convince,
and no respecters of person.</p>

<p>Mary W—-—- had for many years received a dole
of ten shillings every Christmas for coals, but having
obtained regular work at the Hall, the vicar rightly
decided that five shillings in future would meet her
circumstances, the more so as there were many other
deserving cases. At the time appointed he left five
shillings with Mary’s daughter, the mother being
out at the time. On her return she was told of
the vicar’s call, and of the five shillings which he
had left. ‘And what did you do, Mary?’ asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
a lady, some short time afterwards. ‘Deea! deea!
Whya, Ah ’ed t’ fahve shillin’ seal’d an’ posted back
agaan tiv him, afore he left t’ village. Ah’m nut that
poor ’at Ah want for fahve shillin’; an’ if Ah can’t be
treated like a lady wi’ ten shillin’, Ah weean’t be
maad a pauper on; neea, nut if t’ archbishop war ti
cum wiv it hissel.’</p>

<p>Chatting one day with a very old friend of mine,
the Vicar of —-, he gave me the following:—‘In my
younger days,’ said he, ‘I was brought up amongst the
South-country peasantry, and for some time after
I came into the North Riding I was greatly surprised
at the small amount of deference paid to me as their
pastor. So marked was this, that I determined if
possible to discover the reason; so one day I entered
into conversation with a blunt but honest old stone-breaker
I found hard at work by the roadside. “Now,
Willie,” said I, “you are hard at it.” “Aye,” said he,
“Ah’ve gitten ti arn my bit; ya’ve nivver ’ed ti deea a
stroak foor yours.” Not heeding his remark—which,
by the way, a South-country man of like position would
never dared have uttered—I asked: “How is it, Willie,
that none of the villagers ever touch their caps or the
women curtsy when they meet me?” I know it was a
bit snobbish to ask such a question, but I had good
reason for so doing: I wished to find out if I was in
any way remiss. “Touch wer caps an’ co’tsey!” said he,
still continuing to break his stones. “Wa’ve neea call
ti deea owther t’ ane or tither; wa knaw varra larl
aboot ya ez yit.” “But I am your pastor,” I urged,
feeling at that time that was all-sufficient. “That
coonts fer larl,” said the old fellow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> “Ther’s good uns
an’ bad uns ov all soarts. Ah tell ya ’at wa knaw varra
larl aboot ya ez yit. Wa s’all finnd oot efter a bit what
soart o’ stuff yer maad on, bud ya’ll ’a’e ti treead yer
teeas cannily, or wa s’aan’t tak ti ya at all.” All this,’
said my old friend, ’at that time was a complete
revelation to me. Up to then I had been used, anyway
before my face, to something approaching servility,
and here was a stone-breaker plainly telling me
I should have to be very careful, and doing so without
so much as ceasing his work.’ Let me add, the stone-breaker
has been laid to rest now many a year, and
the flock has fully recognized the vicar as their
shepherd, and as one worthy both of their love and
respect; and in their way they give the one and show
the other in a marked degree. It takes a little time
to get at the bottom of our people, but the trying to
do so always brings a plenteous reward.</p>

<p>Mr. Pawson by nature was bumptious. He was
distinctly of the genus <i lang="la">novus homo</i>. He came to
the village as a stranger, and built himself a house,
and from the day he came to reside therein, figuratively
speaking, he began to push the villagers about.
‘He’ll stritch t’ lastic’ (elastic) ’whahl it flees back an’
smacks him i’ t’ feeace,’ said one. And he did. It
happened this way. One day, turning to a small pig-jobber,
he said, ‘Jackson, tell one of your lads to
take my dog back to the house; and, Jackson, he had
better call at the saddler’s and take some repairs along
at the same time.’ Now, as has been already remarked,
this addressing the country folk by their surname is
deeply resented; and in the case of Mr. P. there was
almost open rebellion. Jackson, however, was in no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
way dependent on the self-elected squire; so, winking
to the bystanders, he said, ‘All reet; bud Ah saay,
Mr. Pawson, Ah think ’at ya owt ti saay Mister
when ya speeak ti ma. Ya knaw fau’k’s saying ’at
maist leyklings wa s’all seean be related, ez mah
au’dest lad’s gitten his e’e on that eldest lass o’
yours.’ The roar of laughter which followed was—well,
I pity Mr. Pawson.</p>

<p>A lady of ample means, whose one desire was to
do good to others, found the people very difficult
to approach when she first came amongst them.
As a fact, she knew nothing of the idiosyncrasy of
the Yorkshire people. Said she one day to an old
Yorkshire dame whom she had weeding her garden:
‘Bessy, how is it the people do not take kindly to
me? I am most wishful to help them, and to make
them my friends, but they won’t let me; how is it?’
‘Whya, ya see wa’re a larl bit different mebbe ti t’
fau’k ’at you’ll ’a’e been amang, afoor ya cam inti
these pairts; Ah’ve allus fun’ ya varra canny ti deea
wi’ mysen, Ah will saay that.’ ‘Yes, but how is it
the other cottagers do not seem pleased to see me
when I call?’ ‘Whya, mebbins Ah c’u’d tell ya, bud
Ah deean’t knaw ’at Ah s’u’d be deeaing mysen onny
good if Ah did,’ said Bessy, cautiously. ‘But I should
be greatly obliged to you if you would.’ ‘Aye, ya
saay seea noo, bud ya’d leyklings git yer back up
if Ah tell’d ya.’ ‘No, indeed I won’t; I am really
wishful to know.’ ‘Oha, whya noo, when ya gi’e
ma yer wo’d on ’t, Ah s’ ‘a’e ti gi’e ya a bit ov an
inkling. Noo, it’s leyke this, mum: wa deean’t tak
kindly ti fau’k ’at tak liberties wiv uz. Noo, Ah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
deean’t want ti saay owt ’at’ll vex ya, bud neea doot,
bidoot meeaning it, ya tak a gert deal upon yersen.’
‘In what way?’ asked the lady, being quite unaware
of ever having done anything of the kind. ‘Whya
noo, for yah thing, ya nivver knock at neeabody’s
deear; ya just lift t’ sneck an’ cross t’ deearstan ez
if t’ pleeace belang’d ti ya. An’ Ah’ll tell ya anuther
thing whahl Ah’s aboot it: ya ass<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> a seet ti monny

Ya s’u’dn’t deea seea. Ya wadn’t be sae setten up

wer betters; bud, mahnd ya, wer betters ’ez ti wait
whahl wa deea’t, an’ they ’ev ti let uz deea’t i’ wer
awn waay an’ all, an’ ther’s nowt aboot that,’ concluded
Bessy. Let me add, the lady took the hint,
and in time learnt to love the plain-spoken people
she had come to live amongst; and they gave their
love in return tenfold, which, if rugged and rough at
the edges, only enables you to get a firmer grip of it.</p>

<p>Just a few illustrations proving the practical side of
our character.</p>

<p>In the village schoolroom a lecturer very learnedly
and emphatically discoursed on the human eye.
Amongst other things he declared the eye could
quell the most savage beast. ‘Ah saay,’ said a
sturdy farmer at the close of the lecture, ‘deea ya
ho’d ti be trew all ’at ya’ve been telling uz aboot
wer e’es?’ On assuring him every word was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
true, the lecturer was somewhat staggered by the
farmer’s desire for a practical proof. ‘Whya then,’
said he, ‘Ah’ll tell ya what, Ah deean’t believe owt
’at ya’ve tell’d uz; an’ mair ’an that, if you’ll cum up
ti mah hoos ti morn at morn, Ah’ll gi’e ya a chance
ti tell mah ’at Ah’s wrang. Noo, leeak here, if you’ll
gan inti mah paddock, Ah’ll gie ya leave ti e’e mah
bull ez mich ez ivver ya leyke, an’ if he dizn’t shift
ya afoor ya can count fo’tty, Ah’ll gi’e ya leave ti
tak him yam wi’ ya. Bud you’ll be shifted.’ A friend
calling to see one who was seriously ill, said just
before parting, ‘Whya noo, thoo maun’t gi’e waay;
thoo mun keep thi pluck up, or else it’ll be owered
wi’ tha.’ ‘Aye, mun!’ said the invalid, ‘bud it’s hard
ti keep yan’s pluck up, when yan feels all ov a
shutther. Ah’ll tell tha what, if summat dizn’t
sthraangely alter, Ah’s foor off, an’ ther’s nowt can
ho’d ma back.’ ‘Oha well,’ said the visitor, ‘thoo
owt ti knaw t’ best; bud whativver thoo diz, thoo
maun’t dee iv a horry’ (hurry). ‘It’s fowr mile ti
t’ chetch, an’ thoo’s na leet weight, an Ah s’u’d be
bidden, an’ ‘a’e ti len’ a han’ ti hug tha. Liggin i’
bed a bit taks yan doon a lot; thoo mun try ti hing
on a week or tweea, hooivver.’</p>

<p>Old I—— of Masham, a well-known jobber in days
past, was once asked for a loan. But I will give the
story as given to me years ago by William Scorrer,
than whom a finer specimen of the old school of
Yorkshiremen never lived, and to whom I am indebted
for many of the best stories and other information in
this book. Could you but have heard the old man tell
them—old! why, he never looked old, and he was nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
eighty when I knew him—but you never will hear
him; he has stepped over the line. His style, raciness,
and everything which goes to make a Yorkshire story
worth listening to, were lost when the grave closed
over his last remains. At least, that is to my way
of thinking. I know scores of people who can tell
a Yorkshire story, and tell it admirably, perfect as
to dialect, and humorously, too; but still, there always
lacks that something—I mean crispness; no, sparkle
is the word—which the old chap always managed to
give just at the right moment. ‘Requiescat in pace.’</p>

<p>Pardon me, I will to the story. Old I—— was at
Northallerton Market, when another jobber rushed up
to him. ‘Ah saay,’ said he, ‘c’u’d ta mannish ti len’
uz fahve pund. Ah finnd mysel that sho’t, an’ Ah s’all
loss a grand bargain if Ah caan’t leet on sumbody ’at
’ll len’ uz ’t.’ ‘Whya, thoo knaws, Bill,’ said I——, ‘Ah
deean’t ho’d wi’ lennin’; ta knaws it offens maks frien’s
leeak shy at yan anuther; bud if so be ’at thoo’s gahin
ti miss a bargain, whya, Ah mun stritch a point foor
yance, bud, mahnd tha, thoo ’ezn’t ti mak a common
practis on ’t. Noo, when diz ta think ’at thoo’ll be
yabble ti pay ’t back? An’ what ’ez ta gitten, ’at thoo’s
gahin ti ’liver up ez security?’ ‘Whya, Ah’ll let tha
’a’e my watch, an’ Ah’ll gi’e tha mah wo’d——.’</p>

<p>‘Nivver mahnd thi wo’d, let’s leeak at t’ watch.
Ah tell tha what,’ said I——, when he had the watch in
his hand, ‘thoo mebbins sets gert store byv it thisen,
bud tha’d bunch tha oot ov a pawn shop if thoo war
brazzen’d eneeaf ti ass a pund for ’t. When can ti let
mah ’ev it back?’ ‘Ah’ll gi’e tha ’t at Bedale next
Tuesday.’ ‘Whya noo, Ah’ll trust tha for yance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
bud it’s mair ’an what thi awn feyther ’ud deea. Noo
thoo maun’t tak ma in; Ah s’all leeak for tha ti’
pay ’t back when Ah see tha at Bedale.’ To Bill’s
credit, the money was paid the week following. But
a fortnight afterwards he again begged for a loan,
this time for fifteen pounds. ‘Neea!’ said I——, ‘thoo
teeak mah in yance; Ah’ll nut trust tha na mair.’
‘Teeak tha in! Didn’t Ah pay tha back hard eneeaf
at Bedale, when Ah tell’d tha Ah wad?’ ‘Aye, thoo
paid ma back all reet, bud Ah nivver thowt ’at thoo
wad; naay, thoo’s ta’en ma in yance, Ah weean’t be
on agaan.’</p>

<p>That by nature the Tyke is tenacious of his opinion,
and hard to convince, may be taken as an axiom.
I have referred to this before, but this is a convenient
opportunity to produce proofs of the same.</p>

<p>For years, old Sykes and Hobson, though neighbours,
had been on unfriendly terms. Years back,
Sykes had found on several occasions a certain gate
thrown off its hinges. Whether he held any proof,
history does not recount, but he blamed Hobson for
doing it. Hobson, however, stoutly denied all knowledge
of the affair. Anyway, for long they remained
about as unfriendly as they well could; until one
day, Hobson, at the risk of his life, rescued Sykes’ lad
from drowning. On hearing of the rescue, Sykes
hurried away to thank Hobson. They met in one
of the latter’s fields. ‘Whya, noo then,’ began Sykes,
‘Ah’ve cum’d ti shak tha byv t’ han’; thoo’s saved my
bairn, an’ Ah’s behodden ti tha foor awlus. Noo wa
s’all ’a’e ti let bygones be bygones, an’ start afresh.
Thoo knaws wa used ti hit it off all reet yance ower;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
noo, what diz ta saay?’ ‘Wha, mun, ther’s my hand
on ’t, an’ Ah’s mair ’an glad ’at wa’ve hap’t t’ au’d
sore up at last; an’ ez thoo sez, wa mun start afresh,
just ez if nivver nowt ’ed cum’d atween uz’ So they
shook hands, and talked farming for an hour or so,
until it was time for Sykes to return. Shaking
Hobson by the hand, he said, ‘Noo thoo knaws Ah
s’all nivver be yabble ti mak it up ti tha for saving
t’ lad, an’ Ah’s reet glad ’at Ah can gan yam an’ tell
t’ missus ’at thee an’ me’s kind agaan, an’ Ah whoap
’at wa s’all awlus keep seea. Bud mahnd tha, Ah still
ho’d ti ’t ’at it war thoo ’at flang t’ yat offen t’ creeaks,’
i.e. ‘But bear in mind, I still think it was you who
flung the gate off the hinges.’</p>

<p>Old Hall, a well-known character in one of our
dales, was the doctor for miles round, and proud
was the village wherein he actually resided. He was
more than doctor, he was the vet. as well; he read the
lessons in church; in fact, he was the father of the
village. He was consulted, and his advice acted
upon in all things which are incident to a village
community. And then he died, and a new doctor took
his place—top hat, frock-coat, and everything. Some
little time after his arrival, Wilson’s cow died, and the
death of the said cow was fully discussed the day
following, in the blacksmith’s shop. ‘What did ta
gi’e it?’ asked one. ‘Nowt. Hoo mud Ah knaw what
ti git for ’t?’ ‘Did ta gan for t’ doctor?’ asked
another. ‘Aye, an’ he war neean sae setten up, at
being fetched oot o’ bed i’ t’ middle o’ t’ neet.’
‘Warn’t he! What did he saay?’ ‘He tell’d ma ’at
he warn’t a coo doctor, an’ knew nowt aboot ’em.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>’
‘Did he saay that?’ asked the smith slowly, resting
on his hammer, as he waited for an answer. ‘Aye,
an’ he tell’d ma ti gan yam an’ nivver wakken him up
na mair on sike an earand,’ ‘Wha, then,’ said the
smith very deliberately, ‘he’s nut a Hall! an’ he
mud just ez weel teeam his stuff oot, an’ quit his
bottles foor au’d glass. Foor Ah meean ti saay ’at
a chap ’at dizn’t knaw nowt aboot t’ innards’ (the
inside) ‘of a coo, an’ hosses, an’ pigs, an’ sike leyke,
isn’t gahin ti practis on onny ov uz, ’coz if he ’ezn’t
gitten them off, he caan’t knaw nowt aboot oor
innards, foor wa’re a seet mair intrickiter’ (intricate)
’na onny o’ t’ dumb critters. He’s nut a Hall, an’
he’s na ewse tiv uz.’ The oracle having spoken, it
was agreed on all hands that it was so. And from
that moment the influence of that man as a doctor
ceased.</p>

<p>Here is another, which brings out a trait I purpose
touching upon afterwards. Incidentally, I may mention,
a bargain is a bargain, and must be maintained and
carried out as originally agreed upon. The story,
however, I give as an illustration of how hard it is to
convince our people that their preconceived notion
on any subject is wrong.</p>

<p>It was quite four miles from a certain house to the
village, and as the gardener was often required to go
thither for one thing or another, his master bought
him a bicycle, thinking to make the journey easier
for him. A few days after the machine had been
presented, John said, ‘Noo, sir, Ah wanted ti ’ev a
wo’d wi’ ya. Noo, when Ah cam, Ah cam for ti be t’
gardener, an’ ti deea onny odd jobs ’at wanted deeaing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Bud, ya knaw, Ah s’all want a bit mair a week if Ah’ve
ti larn ti mannish yon thing’—jerking his thumb over
his shoulder in the direction of the tool-house, where
the byke was kept. ‘Ya knaw, sir, ther warn’t nivver
nowt at no tahm owt sed aboot a bisittle, an’ Ah
s’ want a bit mair afoor Ah tattle yon thing. Noo,
hoo mich is ’t ti be?’ The master pointed out that
it was for his (the gardener’s) own comfort, and to
lighten the journey to and from the village, he had
been induced to buy the bicycle. ‘Whya, noo,
Ah deean’t knaw sae mich aboot that,’ said John;
‘it soonds weel eneeaf t’ waay ’at you put it; ther’s
nowt aboot that, bud Ah’ve leeaked fother inti ’t
’an what yow ’ev. Noo, leeak here, it taks me nigh on
ti tweea hoors an’ a hauf ti gan an’ cum walking; noo,
hoo lang is ’t gahin ti tak ma ti deea ’t o’ yon thing?’
‘When you get used to it, you will run there and back
easily in an hour.’ ‘Oha, s’all Ah! Then that’ll be
leyke an hoor an’ a hauf ti t’ good.’ ‘Yes, you will
save quite that.’ ‘Then when Ah git back, s’all Ah
’a’e ti sit ma doon an’ deea nowt for t’ hoor an’ t’ hauf?’
‘Sit down and do nothing! Certainly not; you will
go on with your work.’ ‘Aye, Ah thowt seea; an’
that’s what maks ma saay ’at ya’ll ’a’e ti gi’e ma a larl
bit mair, ez Ah’s gahin ti put sa monny mair hoors’
wark in i’ t’ week. Ya see, you reckon yah waay, an’
Ah reckon another, an’ Ah think Ah’s i’ t’ reet on ’t.’</p>

<p>Those who have given the slightest attention to
the various traits which are so interesting in the
character of our people, will not have failed to notice
one which is very pronounced. I mean the objection
they have to showing, and the cleverness they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
display in hiding, their ignorance on any matter. If
in speaking to our country people you use a word
which they do not understand, they never let you
know that they do not catch your meaning: they
wait until you say ’summat else,’ in the hope that
they may gather therefrom what you mean; and if
you do not happen to say anything which throws
light upon the unknown word, well, there the matter
ends, and as a rule it does not trouble them for one
moment. A farm labourer fell off a bicycle, and
sprained his arm very severely; the doctor, a young
locum, and a trifle pedantic, gave him a bottle of
lotion, saying, as he did so, ‘Your arm will be all
right in a few days: you have strained your biceps, you
must rub it well with this lotion.’ ‘What diz ta think
on him?’ asked one, who had been waiting outside.
‘Whya, he’s nowt bud a fondheead, is yon. What diz
ta think? He sez ’at Ah’ve spraaned my airm, an’ he’s
gi’en ma a bottle o’ stuff ti rub t’ bisittle wiv; let’s
gan ti t’ bone-setter.’ A lady visiting a poor young
fellow who was seriously ill, and very feverish, said
to the mother, ‘Your son is very ill, I fear.’ ‘He is
that, mum; he’s nut foor lang doon here. Hooivver,
wa’ve deean t’ best ’at lay i’ wer power, an’ yan isn’t
yabble ti deea na mair ’an that. Bud Ah’s pleeased
ti saay ’at wa’ve gitten eneeaf saved up ti put him
deeacently by, an’ that’s a blessing. It’ll be a beautiful
funeral, mum, an’ wa’ve let him saay whau’s ti
be bidden; an’ Ah deean’t think he’s forgitten yan ov
his au’d frien’s—bud he awlus was thowtful.’ ‘That
is very nice,’ said the lady, for she understood something
of the people and their ways. ‘I will send you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
a couple of ice wafers,’ said she, thinking they would
be nice for him to cool his lips with. ‘I think your
son will like them, he seems so feverish.’ Next day,
when she inquired how the patient was, the poor
mother said, with tears in her eyes, ‘Thank ya, mum,
Ah think he’s warse.’ ‘Did he like the wafers?’ she
inquired, adding, ‘you can have more.’ ‘Well, mum,’
said the mother, ‘Ah c’u’dn’t saay foor sartin whether
he liked ’em or nut. Ya see, ez seean ez ya sent ’em,
Ah put him t’ white yan on his chist; bud he ’pleeaned
’at it felt varra cau’d, an’ seea Ah teeak it off, an’ put
t’ pink un on a plate i’ front o’ t’ fire ti warm. Bud
Ah think t’ cat must ’a’e gitten ’t, foor it war gone
when Ah went for’t. So ya see, iv a waay, he ’adn’t
a fair go wiv ’em. Bud you needn’t send na mair, he’s
gahin fast noo.’</p>

<p>A gentleman said to a Yorkshire dame, ‘Your little
chap looks very robust.’ ‘Aye, an’ your larl chap
leeaks t’ saame,’ said she; not in the least knowing
what ’robust’ meant. ‘Nay, nay,’ said the gentleman;
‘I only wish he was’—glancing at the very weakly
child he held by the hand. The dame perceived she
had made a mistake, so added, ‘Whya he seean wad
be’; and then, not quite certain of her ground, or
where ‘robust’ was going to land her, continued, ‘bud
then yan nivver knaws.’ When the gentleman had
left the group, one of the bystanders said, ‘Dolly,
what diz ro-bust meean?’ ‘Deean’t ass me, Ah’ve
na mair idea na t’ man i’ t’ meean,’ said she. ‘Then
what maad ta saay ’at his bairn leeaked t’ saame ez
what he sed thahn did?’ ‘Whya, Ah thowt ’at if
he war calling mah bairn naames, Ah’d let him ’ev<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
ez good ez he sent; whahl, if he war sayin’ summat
i’ praise on ’t, Ah sud be deeaing t’ saame byv his.’</p>

<p>On another occasion, a village dame entered the
doctor’s visiting-room. ‘Noo, then,’ she commenced,
‘gie ma summat, an’ leeak sharp aboot it, fer Ah is
badly; Ah can nowther bahd ti sit doon, stan’ up,
ner nowt.’ ‘What is the matter with you?’ inquired
the doctor. ‘Naay, what; it’s neea ewse assing me,
Ah’ve cumd to see you aboot that.’ ‘Well, but what
ails you?’ ‘Aals ma! Ah’ve gitten galloping paans all
reet roond aboot ivverywheear; Ah is badly.’ ‘But
what have you been doing to get them?’ ‘Whya, Ah
can think o’ nowt bud, t’ daay afoor yesterdaay, Ah
war weshin’, an’ Ah mun ’a’e kept a damp ap’on on,
an’ Ah aim ’at it’s gi’en ma cau’d all reet roond aboot
ivverywheer.’ ‘Now I know what’s the matter with
you. Here’s a bottle for you; take it home, and you
had better drink a teaspoonful every ten minutes, and
it will be best if you take it in a recumbent position,’
said he, handing Martha the bottle. Now, ‘recumbent
position’ was quite outside Martha’s vocabulary; she
had not the least idea what he meant, but she was not
going to expose her ignorance by asking. So off home
she set, saying to herself as she went along, ‘“Re-cum-bunt
po-zition;” noo what diz that mean?’ However,
Yorkshire like, she hit upon a plan of getting to know,
without exposing her own ignorance. Calling on
a neighbour as she passed by, she shouted, ‘‘Liza
Jane, Ah’ve been ti t’ doctor, an’ he’s gi’en ma a
bottle o’ stuff, an’ Ah ’ev ti tak a speeanful on ’t ivvery
ten minits; bud he sez ’at Ah ’ev ti tak it in a recumbunt
po-zition. Bud thoo knaws Ah ’evn’t gitten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
yan, an’ Ah thowt mebbe ’at thoo’d be seea good ez
ti let ma ’a’e t’ len’ o’ thahn; will ta?’ Liza Jane
knew no more what ’recumbunt po-zition’ meant than
Martha, but she was not going to give herself away,
so she replied, ‘Ah wad ’a’e deean sa wi’ t’ gertest
o’ pleasure i’ t’ wo’lld, nobbut Ah lent mahn yisterday.
Bud ez thoo gans up t’ village, call in at t’ shop an’ buy
yan for thisen, an’ then thoo’ll ’ev it at heeam when
thoo wants it; an’ if tha ’evn’t gitten yan, buy a mug—it’ll
deea just t’ seeam.’</p>

<p>One more. Bessy having explained to the doctor
that her husband was suffering from a fearful pain in
the head, was ordered to apply the half-dozen leeches
which he gave her. Now, had the doctor said, ‘stick
’em on,’ or ’clap ’em on,’ Bessy would have known
what she had to do with them. However, she had
half a dozen leeches to do something with, so she went
home and did her level best. A couple of days after,
the doctor, seeing Bessy, asked her how John was.
‘Oh, he’s all reet noo. Them things capped him;
tha did, hooivver.’ ‘You managed all right, did you,
Bessy?’ asked he. ‘Whya, Ah caan’t saay ’at wa
mannished sa weel wi’ t’ fo’st un ’at Ah gav’ him; he
chow’d on wi’ ‘t, bud he c’u’d catch ho’d on ’t neea
road, soa Ah boil’d him t’ rest, an’ he sluthered ’em
doon neycely.’</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>WIT AND CHARACTER—<i>continued</i></small></h2>


<p>There are many other side-lights to our character,
only a few of which it will be possible to notice. But
every story is pictured in such varying light and
shade as to afford those who can fully appreciate
them many varied traits of our character. And one
word, if you please, with reference to these stories.
Nearly all have the merit of being in essence true.
They have been gathered from various sources, but
in the main first hand. Many of the characters were
known personally to the writer; and although in a few
instances the origin and authenticity are doubtful,
they are included because they so fully illustrate that
which was to be demonstrated, and because they
are so true to life, and just what would really have
happened under like circumstances.</p>

<p>There is one special gift which the Yorkshireman
possesses in a high degree, i.e. the humorous. It is a
humorousness, too, which often (given that you understand
and appreciate the dialect) sparkles with genuine
wit. I plead guilty to the fact that much of the wit of
our country-people is, as it were, given with the back of
the hand. Still, it is none the less witty, for all that.
And if the same sounds rough and unmusical to you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
kindly bear in mind that the Chinese consider our
best music little else than a tumult of discordant
sound. It is generally the last few words uttered
which contain the bud, blossom, and fruit all in one. I
remember once being completely shut up by a Yorkshire
lad, and he only uttered two words; but the tone
and the look were the very cream of sarcastic jeering.
This was how it came about. The lad was driving
home some ducks from the pond. ‘You have a lot of
fine ducks, my boy,’ said I. And then, thinking to
buy a couple, I asked, ‘How often do you kill them?’
‘Nobbut yance,’ was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>‘T’ law’s nowt bud a tak in all t’ waay thruff,’ said one.
‘When me an’ Tom went afoor wer betters aboot that
hedge, Ah’d Jackson ti talk foor me, an’ he ’ed Smith
ti talk foor him. An’ ti lissen ti them tweea blackguarding
yan anuther when t’ case war on, yan mud
‘ thowt ’at tha war i’ arnist, an’ ‘at tha nivver wad ’a’e
spokken civil t’ ane tither agaan; bud bless mah leyfe,
when t’ case war adjourned ti t’ next court daay, an’
when me an’ Tom, scooling at yan anuther leyke all
that, went inti t’ Black Lion ti ’ev a glass o’ yal, if
wa didn’t finnd them tweea takking wine an’ ‘ranging ti
gan fishing tigither t’ next daay. “Tom,” sez Ah, “if
this is t’ waay tha mak t’ feeal o’ yan, seeaner thee an’
me haps t’ business up an’ t’ better it’ll be foor baith
on uz.” An’ he sez ti me, “Gi’e uz thi han’ on’t,”
an’ Ah did. An’ then Ah shoots oot, “Hi! Ah’ll tell
ya what, you tweea ’ed best ’range to gan fishing foor
awlus; bud mahnd ya, nowther me ner Tom’s gahin
ti finnd t’ bait for owther on ya!”</p>

<p>Sally Ridge was a terror to all those she took a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
dislike to. She usually played some prank to the
detriment of those who, for the time being, were out of
favour. On one occasion, however, she went a trifle
too far; she broke the back of a duck with a stone.
This got poor Sally into fearfully hot water, and there
was every likelihood of her being summoned; however,
the writer interceded on her behalf, and on Sally
faithfully promising never to stone a duck again, she
was pardoned. Within an hour afterwards, I surprised
her gaily pitching stones amongst the feathered
swimmers. ‘Didn’t you promise me faithfully not to
throw stones at the ducks again, Sally?’ I asked,
taking hold of her, and adding, ‘it is wicked of you to
break your word in this way.’ ‘Ah ’evn’t brokken my
wo’d,’ replied Sally, trying to free herself. ‘But you
have; you promised not to throw stones at the ducks
again,’ I repeated. ‘An’ Ah isn’t; Ah’s thrawing at
yon geese, an’ it’s nut mah fau’t if t’ silly au’d ducks
git thersens i’ t’ road. Leave lowse, Ah nivver sed
nowt ti naebody aboot geese.’</p>

<p>Three visitors hired a boat at Staithes for an hour’s
fishing, having a man each to attend to their lines.
On returning to land, the fishermen were paid half
a crown for the sail. The visitors had not got far away,
when one of the fishermen ran after them. ‘Ah saay,
mister,’ said he, turning the half-crown over in his
hand, ‘ya see ther’s three on uz, an’ nut being schollars,
wa’re bet ti knaw hoo ti share ’t oot; bud Ah’ll tell
ya what wa deea knaw,’ he added, with a merry twinkle
in his eye, ‘if ya war ti gi’e uz anuther sixpence, wa
s’u’d ’ev a bob apiece.’ And they got it.</p>

<p>An old keeper was told off to hand the gun for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
a very poor shot. After blazing away at several
coveys, he turned to the old chap, saying, ‘I am
afraid you will think me a very bad shot!’ ‘Nut Ah.
Ah think ’at Ah nivver seed naebody shut better
an’ hit warse i’ mah leyfe.’ ‘And yet I have made
many a good bag before to-day,’ said the sportsman,
just a wee bit nettled. ‘Aye, bud oor bo’ds flee,
tha deean’t sit ti be shutten at,’ was the quiet rejoinder.</p>

<p>Lady —- said to one of her under-gardeners,
‘Thomas, the maids tell me that you often say very
nasty things about women; do you ever do the same
of the men?’ And then her ladyship looked him
squarely in the face, but Thomas was equal to the
occasion. ‘Neea, my lady, that Ah deean’t, acoz i’
that case it ’ud be trew, ya knaw.’</p>

<p>Tommy had been fishing on Sunday; he had been
caught red-handed by the Chapel minister. The
good man read Tommy a long lesson on the enormity
of his sin, concluding by asking what Tommy had
to say for himself. ‘It’s nut a real rod!’ ventured
Tommy. ‘That does not matter,’ said his judge;
‘the sin is just the same, and the Lord never prospers
those who break the sabbath.’ ‘Wha, then,’ promptly
replied Tommy, ‘it mun ’a’e been Au’d Scrat’ (i.e.
Satan) ‘’at’s egg’d ’em on ti bite ti-daay, foor Ah
nivver catched sa monny afoor’—holding up a bottle
fairly alive with sticklebacks and minnows.</p>

<p>Whether I am succeeding or not is for others to
judge, but what I am striving to do is to paint the
various points in our character faithfully. I am
neither hiding nor glossing. Our brusquerie and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
doggedness, our tenacity of opinion and keenness to
acquire the all-needful, our pride and independency,
as also our want of that respect for those who
may consider themselves our superiors, have been
as fully and as truthfully set forth as space would
admit of.</p>

<p>On the other hand, our people are warm-hearted,
hospitable to a degree, and exhibit a deep sense of
gratitude for favours received, such as would never
be credited by those who judge us by our rugged exterior.
But it is there, for all that. Let me give
you two or three stories quite true, which prove to
some extent what I have just asserted.</p>

<p>A woman possessed an old, carved corner cupboard,
not really worth much, but it had been her
mother’s, and she prized it greatly—in fact, far above
its market value. The village doctor had often tried
to buy it, but without success. Her husband falling
seriously ill, the doctor was called in, and though
there was no hope of a long bill being paid, he was
most assiduous in his attendance day and night.
When recovering, the patient, fully aware that he
had been fairly snatched from the grave, said to
his wife one night, when she was sitting by the bedside,
‘Fanny, thoo’ll ’a’e ti let t’ doctor ’ev t’ cupboard.’
He well knew what a wrench this would be, and was
no little surprised when his wife replied, ‘Bless tha,
mun, ez seean ez ivver thoo gat a to’n foor t’ better,
Ah ’ed t’ cupboard rovven doon, an’ sent Bob wi’ ‘t.
Doctor didn’t want ti ’a’e ’t, an’ sent it back, bud
Ah sent Bob wiv it agaan, an’ tell’d him ti saay ’at
if he sent it back onny mair Ah’d mak firewood on ’t.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Thoo’s wo’th mair ’an all t’ cupboards i’ t’ wo’lld ti
me, an’ it war t’ only road ther war o’ paying him.’</p>

<p>Again. An old dame having been ill for a long time,
recovered, much to the surprise of every one. During
her long illness a certain lady often visited her, and
sent her many little comforts. Some months after
the old dame’s recovery, she presented her benefactress
with an elaborate clip-hearthrug. For this
the lady wished to pay her, but that the old dame
almost indignantly refused. ‘Neea, mum,’ said she,
with tears in her eyes; ‘Ah’ve ’ed ommaist ivvery bit
o’ t’ stuff gi’en ma ’at Ah’ve maad t’ clips on, an’ if
ivvery prod ’at Ah’ve gi’en an’ ivvery clip ’at Ah’ve
cutten war a gowden guinea, it wadn’t mak up foor
hauf your kindness ti me.’ Oh no, they do not lack
gratitude.</p>

<p>The vicar’s bride had a remark made to her by one
of the oldest men in the village, which seemed to her
to have a nasty application, but in its idiomatic sense
it was quite innocent of any such construction; and
the remark as addressed to the lady was certainly
given in its idiomatic form. By-and-by she learnt
she had been a little hasty in condemning the old
fellow. However, to make up for any unkindness
on her part, she engaged the old man as a sort of
anything-you-like about the vicarage. It was not
long ere the old chap won a very warm place in
the lady’s heart. This was after the arrival of the
baby. Every night, when his work was done, he
would say, ‘Noo then what, Ah’ve deean; bud Ah
mun ’ev a leeak at t’ baa’n afoor Ah gan.’ One
evening, after this same formula had been gone through,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
he said, ‘Noo, Ah’ll tell ya what; t’ baa’n’s nut sa
varra weel ti-neet, an’ Ah knaw a seet mair aboot
babbies ’an what you deea. Noo you mun put ’t iv
a hot bath, an’ then hap ’t up an’ keep ’t varra warm.
Noo you mun deea ez Ah’ve tell’d ya.’ With this
admonition he left the vicarage, and, though turned
seventy-eight years of age, set off at once to
trudge seven miles for a doctor, landing back again
about midnight. The doctor assured the delighted
mother that, having followed the old man’s advice,
and with the remedies he had brought, a severe fit
of croup had been staved off. Oh yes, these blunt
country-people have feelings. And they are grateful.</p>

<p>Gratitude shows itself in different ways, sometimes
in a form of self-sacrifice, as in the following, which
occurred not so very long ago. Said a vicar to one
of his parishioners—who, by-the-way, was a notorious
poacher—‘I am very pleased to see you coming to
church so regularly; very pleased, indeed, William;
and I trust that it may lead you to see the
error of your past life.’ ‘Well, Ah wadn’t gan sa
far ez ti saay ’at owt o’ that soart’s leykley ti
happen, bud Ah s’ cum ti t’ chetch, for all that.’
‘And may I ask the reason for this sudden change
in your life?’ inquired the parson. ‘Whya noo,
it war i’ this waay. Me an’ Luke an’ tweea or
three uthers war talking ya ower yah neet i’ t’ Swan,
an’ Luke sed ’at he didn’t ho’d wi’ neea parsons
’at hunted, an’ Ah sed ’at a parson war nowt neea
different ti neeabody else, when he’d ta’en t’ white
goon off, an’ ‘at it maad neea odds whether ya
hunted or whether ya didn’t. Bud t’ main on ’em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
seeamed ti ho’d ’at ya warn’t i’ t’ reet on ’t hunting.
And seea Ah thowt ti mysen, t’ parson’s offens
deean me a good to’n, an’ if ther’s gahin to be
sike a lot o’ narrer-mahnded fau’k i’ t’ village—an’
being a bit of a sportsman mysen, ya knaw—wha,
Ah sez, noo Ah’ll gan ti chetch if it’s foor nowt
else bud ti back ya up a bit, an’ sa Ah cums.’</p>

<p>The hospitality of the Yorkshire people is so well
known, and so generally admitted by all those who
have been recipients of the same, that I purpose just
leaving it as an established fact. Still, there is one
curious offshoot from this generous branch, which
needs <i lang="fr">en passant</i> a moment’s consideration.</p>

<p>I once heard a South-country man say, ‘Yorkshire
people give you more than you want at their table,
and then beg from you on the doorstep.’ And
to those who know nothing of our ways, usages,
and customs, such would almost seem to be the
case. Of course, as put by the South-country man,
the statement, if complete, would stamp Yorkshire
and its people as being rather more than contemptible.
But such is not the case, and when the reason for
the remark was perfectly sifted, the notion which
had got such a firm hold of the speaker was found
to have been based on a want of knowledge of the
elementary rules which govern the unwritten law
of bargaining. Why, pages could be written on
bargaining, and stories told by the score.</p>

<p>But when a bargain has been concluded, the money
paid, the receipt given, a substantial meal partaken of,
with grog, &amp;c., ad lib., it becomes quite easy to understand
the South-country man’s surprise, on leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the house, to be asked ’ti gi’e summat back foor
luck.’ To him, not knowing our ways, the transaction
was completed; with us it was not, and
therein lies the difference. It does strike one as
peculiar to find such marked generosity, when run
on certain lines, only to be confronted the next
step with some little action which at first sight looks
very much like meanness. But all this misconception
vanishes if we bear in mind that <em>hospitality</em> and
<em>business</em> are never made to clash; they, as it were,
occupy separate rooms.</p>

<p>I have a story in my mind which illustrates fully
these peculiarities, as well as others already mentioned.
As it was given to me by his lordship, so briefly let
me give it to you.</p>

<p>One day two of a shooting party, his lordship
and the Hon. G——, decided to give their guns
a rest, and visit an ancient church some six miles
distant. They were strongly advised to take a keeper
with them, but feeling quite sure they could find
their way, started by themselves. Possibly they
might have succeeded, had not a sea fret and heavy
fog wrapped the whole moor in a shroud. They
were lost, and they knew it. Fortunately, when
quite worn out, they discovered a farm-house; and on
inquiry they were told that they had wandered much
out of their way, being then quite ten miles from
the shooting-box. Too tired to walk back, they asked
the farmer if he could possibly drive them. ‘Whya,
Ah c’u’d,’ said he, ‘bud it’s a langish waay, an’ mah
meer’s a bit tired; Ah’d ommaist rayther set ya
ti wheer you c’u’dn’t loss yersels.’ They, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
declared they were too tired to think of walking,
and offered him half a sovereign as an inducement.
Then the bargaining propensity came to the surface.
‘Haaf a sover’ign!’ said he. ‘Neea, what ya’ll ’a’e ti
mak it fifteen bob.’ To which they assented. During
this bargaining, the good wife was spreading the table
with abundance of food. ‘Noo then,’ said the good
man, ‘ya mun’ reeach teea an’ mak yersens at heeam.
Ya’re welcome ti t’ best o’ what wa’ve gitten; deean’t
be neyce aboot it, ther’s plenty mair wheer that’s
cum’d fra; Ah’ll cum roond wi’ t’ meer efter a bit.’
When they were ready for departure, one of them
inquired how much they were indebted for their
splendid repast. To which the farmer, in characteristic
fashion, made answer: ‘What wa’ve gi’en ya, wa’ve
gi’en ya, an’ ya’re welcome ti ’t; drhaaving ya ti
t’ shutting-box war a bargain, an’ anuther thing
altigither, an’ ther’s nowt aboot that.’ And not a
penny piece could either be prevailed upon to receive
for their hospitality.</p>

<p>Just one other story, which illustrates the same
propensity for bargaining. A hamper containing a
dead ‘pricky-back otch’n,’ with one shilling carriage
to pay, was delivered to one Pettigrew; by some means
he found out that the hamper had been the property
of a friend of his, named Tom Scott. But Scott declared
on his word of honour that he was innocent of
the whole transaction. Unfortunately, Pettigrew did
not believe him, in consequence of which a coolness
sprang up, which lasted for two years. At the expiration
of that time, Pettigrew met Scott one market-day.
‘Whya, noo then,’ said he, ‘they tell ma ’at tho<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>o’s
gahin ti wed mah cousin Martha; is ’t trew?’ ‘Aye,
it’s trew hard eneeaf, Ah is, hooivver,’ acknowledged
Scott. ‘Whya, then thoo knaws thee an’ me owtn’t
ti be at loggerheeads when t’ ane’s gahin ti be
related ti t’ ither; owt wa, noo?’ ‘Neea, bud thoo
knaws ’at it’s neea fau’t o’ mahn; Ah’ve nowt agaan
tha, thoo knaws,’ said Scott.</p>

<p>‘Wha, bud Ah’d gert call ti blaam tha; thoo’ll awn
ti t’ hamper, weean’t ta?’ ‘Aye, Ah nivver, ’at Ah
mahnd on, ivver tried ti disawn ’t. What mud Ah
foor? Sumboddy stowl ’t; Ah c’u’dn’t help that,
onny road, c’u’d Ah?’</p>

<p>‘Then thoo’d nowt i’ t’ wo’lld ti deea wi’ t’ pricky-back
otch’n?’ ‘Ah’ve tell’d tha ower an’ up agaan
i’ tahms back ’at Ah’d nivver nowt i’ noa waay
whatsoivver owt ti deea wi’ t’ otch’n,’ said Scott,
emphatically.</p>

<p>‘Whya, thoo knaws ’at Ah ’ed a shilling ti pay
for ’t cuming; what’s gahin ti be deean aboot that,
then?’ ‘Whya, thoo dizn’t leeak ti me for ’t, diz
ta?’ ‘Whya, Ah war that oot o’ pocket, an’ it war
thi hamper ’at it cam in hard eneeaf.’ ‘Aye, an’
Ah’ll tell tha what, thoo’s nivver let ma ’a’e ’t back
agaan; bud nivver mahnd, thoo mun keep t’ hamper,
an’ wa’ll lap t’ job up that waay,’ magnanimously
offered Scott.</p>

<p>‘Ah see ’at Ah’s boun ti be oot o’ pocket wi’ t’
otch’n,’ persisted Pettigrew, ‘bud Ah’ll tell tha what,
thoo mun stan’ uz a glass foor friendship’s sake.’
‘Whya, noo then, ez Ah’s gahin ti wed thi cusin
Martha, cu’ thi waay.’ And so the matter was settled.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>WIT AND CHARACTER—<i>continued</i></small></h2>


<p>I purpose devoting this chapter to stories which
in themselves are good examples, embracing, as they
do, many phases of Yorkshire character. With the
exception of the first two or three, they will be given
regardless of classification. But these two or three
do need just a word. Our country-people, in their
own way, hold in sincere veneration all spiritual
teaching; but don’t look for too much. Bear in mind,
superstition dies hard, and in judging them on this
head, it is well to keep to the forefront the fact
that in religion, as well as in everything else, they
cling to much which their grandmothers believed
before them, just as they speak of their parents as
‘t’ au’d fau’k,’ without in the least being disrespectful.
So, without the least intention of being irreverent,
the Deity is often addressed and spoken of in a
manner which would shock the ears of many. ‘Ah
wadn’t ’a’e deean that if Ah’d been Him,’ said an
old dame, after hearing how the Israelites had been
punished by God’s vengeance. ‘He owt ti ’a’e letten
’em off that tahm,’ was her concluding remark. It
was her opinion, and she freely gave it. The Deity
being spoken of as ‘Him’ and ‘He,’ was as natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
to the old lady as it would have been for us to say
‘the Lord.’ Anyway, for real piety, I for one make
my bow to the old dame.</p>

<p>Again, they have a way of materializing the most
spiritual things. To them, heaven is nothing more
than a big, beautiful city, which they have to try their
best to get into, and having managed to do so, they
are safe for ever. Doubtlessly they picture it sunnier,
purer, and altogether more delightful than any place
they have ever seen or heard of. But to them it is
just a city. Certainly this applies more especially to
the older people in our dales; the rising generation
are learning different, but it will be long before they
altogether leave the old and beaten track. And may
it be so, for, after all, their religion is to them a
very real and tangible thing. It is something which
in these days of higher criticism many of us are
letting slip from us. When reading the following
stories, it should be borne in mind why they are
given, and just what I wish to illustrate.</p>

<p>A clergyman having asked an old dying woman
if she were quite happy, received this reply: ‘Neea,
that Ah isn’t. Ah’s boun to dee, an’ Ah s’ gan ti
heaven, an’ it’s that what’s boddering ma. Nut gahin
ti heaven—Ah deean’t meean that—bud t’ music,’ said
she, emphatically. ‘Ya see, Ah’ve nivver larnt nowt
o’ music; Ah knaw nowt aboot it, an’ if tha start
ma off wiv owther a harp or a dulcima, Ah s’all
mak nowt bud a laughing-stock o’ mysel, for Ah
can nowther tune ner scrat on ’em. Noo, if ’t c’u’d be
’ranged foor ma ti tak care o’ yan o’ t’ angel babbies,
Ah s’u’d be ez reet ez ninepins, foor Ah allus did git<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
on wi’ childer, an’ Ah’d fetch it up a pattern, an’
Ah’d promise nivver ti slap it; onny road, Ah s’all
mak nowt ow ’t wiv a dulcima.’</p>

<p>The village artist was dying; he had painted three
out of the four village signs, he had executed the
scrollwork for every church decoration for years
past, and there was in his house an imitation marble
mantelpiece, which he had yearned to show every
one. The clergyman was about to leave him, but
before doing so, asked if he should pray. ‘Aye,
aye,’ said the dying man, ‘and ez mebbe this’ll be
t’ last tahm ’at ya will pray foor ma, Ah s’u’d be
glad if ya’d mention ’at Ah’s a good hand at
decorating; it’ll mebbe help yan a bit.’</p>

<p>Old Matthew was a well-known character. For
years both he and his old dame lived in a little
cottage near Newton-under-Rosebery. When on
his death-bed, a lady, after reading to him, said,
‘And after all I have read and told you, Matthew,
heaven is more beautiful than you can possibly
imagine; you might lie and call to mind all the
beautiful things you have either seen or dreamt of,
and even then you would not have the least idea
what heaven is like.’ To say the least, she was
somewhat surprised when the old man, gently patting
her hand, said in a whisper, ‘Ya mebbe deean’t knaw
’at Ah yance seed Leeds pantomine; that gave yan
a inkling.’ N.B.—The Yorkshire people always
pronounce ‘pantomime’ as spelt above.</p>

<p>Old Bessy, who lived in an old house near Kildale,
was very near the borderland. The clergyman found
her quite happy and reconciled, and on leaving her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
(he was going away for some time), said, ‘Well, goodbye,
Bessy; I may never see you on earth again, but
I shall hope to meet you in heaven.’ ‘Aye, an’ Ah
s’ leeak oot for ya cuming; an’ deean’t forgit ’at neean
on uz is nowt na different up yonder, so you maun’t
git yer back up if Ah just shak ya byv t’ han’, an’
saay, famil’ar leyke, ’at Ah’s glad ti see ’at ya’ve
mannished it.’</p>

<p>The rest of this chapter is merely a collection of
Yorkshire stories, which I think should not be lost, and
which I leave to the perspicuity of my readers, who
doubtless, without any hints from me, will grasp the
many different phases of character contained therein.</p>

<p>The tire had come off the cart wheel, and the Tyke
was in a bit of a fix; shortly afterwards a cyclist drew
up, and dismounting, remarked, ‘Punctchard. Can
I lend you my pump?’ and then burst out laughing
at the man’s dilemma and his own wit. ‘Punctchard?
neea, Ah isn’t punctchard,’ retorted the Tyke, in fairly
good imitation of the would-be wit. ‘An’ thoo can
stick ti thi pump; bud Ah deean’t knaw what thoo
wants it fer, fer thoo’d be all t’ better if thoo war
punctchard thisen a larl bit; it ’ud let sum o’ thi gas
oot, foor thoo’s ommaist brussen wi’ ‘t.’ And then he
set to work to replace the tyre, as though no cyclist
had appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>Several rustics were admiring two brand-new
machines, whilst the owners (a lady and gentleman)
regaled themselves in the village pub. When about
to start on their journey again, the young fellow,
taking stock of the group, and, as he thought,
seeing good material for a joke, said, ‘Admiring our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
machines?’ and then, nudging his fair companion,
continued, ‘These are the very latest; they can either
be used as cycles, musical boxes, or garden mowers.
I only have to turn a screw, that’s all. Clever, aren’t
they?’ ‘Aye!’ said one of the group, looking as if
he had swallowed every word just uttered. ‘It’s
wunnerful what they’ve gitten ’em ti deea noo; my
weyfe’s gitten yan ’at gans wiv a can an’ milks t’ coos
all byv itsen.’ Then those two proceeded on their
journey.</p>

<p>There had been a terrific thunderstorm, lasting most
of the night. Talking the matter over next day,
one said, ‘Did ta ivver hear owt ti cum up tul ’t?’
‘Naay, it gav mah a to’n yance or twice. What diz ta
mak on’t?’ ‘It’s t’ aliments’ (elements), ’thoo knaws;
it’s t’ aliments.’ ‘Aye, thoo’s reet, it’ll be t’ aliments;
bud, Ah saay, it sets yan on ti think.’ ‘It diz, an’ all;
just eftther that despert lood crack cam, Ah thowt ti
mysen, it’s gahin ti be all owered wiv uz; an’ foor
a larl bit Ah wished ’at Ah’d ta’en Tom’s bid foor t’
colt.’</p>

<p>A delightful gathering had taken place at the
rectory, followed by a most sumptuous tea. The
people had come to celebrate the home-coming of
the rector and his bride (a very dear South-country
lady). After tea, the bride, speaking to an old fellow,
said, ‘I hope you have enjoyed yourself?’ To which
kind inquiry he promptly replied, ‘Whya noo, Ah’ve
been at monny a warse do ner this—Ah ’ev that.’
This really was the very highest praise he could
possibly have given. The bride, somewhat annoyed
at what she considered the ingratitude of the man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
turned to an old dame she saw walking down the
drive. ‘Have you tired yourself?’ she kindly inquired.
‘Tired mysen? Neea, Ah’ve nut tired mysen.
Ah ’edn’t need git mysen tew’d at a do leyke this.
Ah’s nut tired, bud Ah’s gahin yam. Ah wad ’a’e
stopped on ti t’ end, bud ther’s that monny flees
aboot t’ pleeace, whahl yan dizn’t knaw what ti deea
wi’ yan’s sen, an’ sae Ah’s foor off.’ The only thing
which had been made at all clear to the bride was
that the old lady complained of being troubled with
fleas, which she found too many for her. ‘Fleas!’
said she; ‘I feel sure you are mistaken.’ To which
the old lady made this reply: ‘Noa, Ah’s nut; but
Ah deean’t meean fleas ’at’s fleas, bud flees ’at
flee’ (flies that fly), leaving the rector’s wife more
bewildered than ever.</p>

<p>A new-comer related to those assembled in the
village bar a most marvellous story of an accident
from which his son had just recovered. If anything,
it erred on the side of being just a trifle too marvellous.
Several said, ‘How wonderful!’ but there was
one man sitting in the far corner, and spake he never
a word. ‘Perhaps you doubt my story?’ ventured
the narrator. ‘Nut Ah. Ah’ve neea call ti doot owt
’at ya’ve tell’d uz, foor yance yan o’ mah lads
swaller’d a pin, an’ ya can tak mah wo’d for ’t, bud
i’ less ’an a month eftther it cam oot o’ t’ back ov his
brother’s neck. That’ll match your taal onny daay.’</p>

<p>The following conversation between two old mothers
was overheard by a clergyman who happened to be
travelling in the same compartment of the train. Said
one to the other, ‘Whya, noo then, wa’ve gitten him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
sahded by.’ ‘Aye, wa ’ev,’ sighed the other; ‘Ah’ve
knawn him ivver sin he war a lad.’ ‘Thoo ’ez, an’ what
thoo knaws ’at Ah went ti skeeal wiv him?’ ‘Aye,
thoo did,’ said her friend; ‘Ah’d forgitten that. Ah
saay, Mary, what a beautiful corpse he maad—sae still
an’ sae quiet, bud they maistly are.’ ‘Aye, aye,’ said
Mary, slowly adding, ‘bud what a tea it war; Ah’ve
nivver been at sike an a-sitting doon i’ mah leyfe;
ther war nowt bud tea-cakes, an’ badly buttered at
that. Noo Ah’ve sahded fahve o’ my awn, bud
thank the Lord Ah buried ’em all wi’ ham,’ which
was a sign not only of great respectability, but as
having shown proper respect to the dead.</p>

<p>Taking my seat in a third-class carriage at Malton,
two men and a woman joined me, and much edified
by their conversation I was. They commenced discussing
the merits of an entertainment which had
been given the night previous in one of the villages in
the neighbourhood. I gathered from their remarks
that Lady M—— and the Hon. Mrs. B—— had
taken an active part in organizing the same. However,
for the moment, Lady M—— was very freely discussed.
The woman had possession of the carriage, and almost
without drawing breath said, ‘Noo, sha’s a grand
un, is t’ au’d leddy; sha’s gam foor owt. Mah songs,
Ah nivver cam across t’ leykes on her onnywheear
else; bud ther isn’t sike anuther onnywheear aboot
here, an’ Ah knaw summat aboot t’ maist on
’em. Sha’s nut yan o’ theease twopenny-haupenny
upstarts ’at dizn’t knaw what’s matter wiv ’em hauf
ther tahm. Aye, sha’s a grand un, is t’ au’d leddy.’
‘Aye, sha is,’ joined in one of the men, as the woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
ceased for want of breath. ‘An’ Ah’ll tell ya what,
that au’dist lad ov hers isn’t a bad un, an’ Ah meean
ti saay ’at his lordship can rear poultry ’at neean on
’em can touch aboot here; noo, he can. He’s a rare
han’ wi’ bo’ds, is his lordship.’ ‘Him rear poultry!’
burst in the woman. ‘Him rear poultry!’ she
repeated, with ineffable scorn; and then, slowly and
emphatically (you, who are Yorkshire people, know
exactly what I mean), she added, ‘Ah meean ti saay
’at t’ au’d leddy can mak a hen lay mair eggs ’an
onny man, woman, or bairn i’ this countrysahd; an’
Ah’ll tell ya what, if tha deean’t gi’e her yan o’ t’
best harps ti plaay on when sha dees an’ gans ti
heaven, Ah’ll ’a’e nowt ti deea wi’ ‘t.’</p>

<p>A vicar once asked his sexton what he thought of
the previous Sunday’s preacher. The pulpit had
been occupied on that occasion by a clergyman
whose oratorical powers are pretty widely known, but
whose sermon had been quite over the heads of his
congregation on that particular day. The reply the
vicar got was certainly to the point. ‘Whya, Ah
wadn’t saay bud what mebbe you mud larn
summat fra what he tell’d uz, acoz ther’s neea
doot ’at he war varra far larnt; bud ez foor me, an’
t’ likes o’ me, wa’d reyther sit an’ lissen ti t’ saam
au’d ditties fra you ’at wa’ve heeard ower an’ up
agaan. Aye, that wa wad; ya see, wa knaw what’s
cuming.’</p>

<p>A neighbour’s third wife lay dead. Said a dame to
the husband, ‘Mary’s gone! Dear me, hoo sum fau’k
diz ’ev bad luck; thoo’ll ’a’e ti gan ti t’ burying,
hooivver.’ ‘Naay,’ said the husband, ‘Ah deean’t think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
’at Ah s’all gan this tahm; Ah went ti t’ tother tweea—they’ll
‘ ti mannish bidoot ma this tahm.’ ‘Naay,
what, thoo’ll ’a’e ti gan, hooivver; it’ll nivver deea
eftther seeing t’ other tweea sahded by, nut ti gan ti t’
tho’d un. Whativver maks tha think ’at thoo weean’t

Ah’ve nivver been yabble ti return t’ compliment,
an’ Ah deean’t leyke ti put on a chap, an’ Ah s’aan’t

<p>A good dame found her husband lying on the
chamber floor. ‘Whativver is ta deeaing, ligging on t’
cham’er fleear foor?’ ‘Aa, lass,’ the old chap groaned,
‘Ah thowt Ah war boun ti dee; Ah did, hooivver. If
ivver Ah’s ta’en leyke that agaan, Ah s’aan’t cum
round na mair; thoo’ll finnd ma deead wheear Ah

whativver thoo diz, noo, thoo maun’t dee unbeknawn.
It’s varra inconsiderate o’ fau’k ti tak thersens off i’

<p>Old Sally was dying. On being asked by the vicar
if she felt quite happy, the old lady said, with great
unction, ‘Oh yes, Ah s’all seean be iv Jacob’s
bosom.’ ‘Abraham’s bosom, Sally,’ corrected the
vicar. ‘Aye, well, mebbe it is, bud if you’d been
unmarried for sixty-fahve year, leyke what Ah ’ev, ya
wudn’t be particular wheeas bosom it war, seea lang
ez ya gat inti sumbody’s.’</p>

<p>A good story is told in Gloucestershire, which is
a fair example that Yorkshiremen are credited with
being able to take care of themselves by those of
other counties. An ostler at one of the inns in
that county in a general way managed to draw
a tip from all who put up, even from one or two
chaps who were well known as being very greedy.
Said a gentleman one day to the ostler, who had
just led out of the yard the horse and trap of one
of these penurious old chaps, ‘Did you manage to
drag a tip out of him?’ ‘Aye,’ said the ostler, ‘he
awlus gi’es ma summat, bud it ommaist brecks his
heart ivvery tahm he gans away.’ ‘Yorkshire, are
you not?’ questioned the gentleman. ‘Aye, Ah’s
Yorkshire hard eneeaf,’ was the characteristic reply.
‘Why,’ said the questioner, with a smile, ‘I am
a bit surprised, seeing that you have been here so

To which, with a twinkle in his eye, the ostler replied,
‘It mebbe wad ’a’e deean afoor noo, if my maister
’edn’t been Yorkshire an’ all.’</p>

<p>A story is told of two Yorkshire Tykes bargaining—of
course this was a case of ’when Greek meets Greek.’
Said one, ‘Whya, noo then, John, what diz ta think if
wa mak a unseen swap on ’t? Thoo ’ezn’t seen mah
meer, an’ Ah ’evn’t seen tha cob; bud Ah knaw ’at
thoo awlus leyked t’ meer, an’ Ah’ve awlus ’ed a bit

lads, an’ ez thoo ’ezn’t seen t’ cob an’ Ah ’evn’t seen t’

bargain was struck. Then said one to the other,
‘Whya, it’s owered noo. Ther’s neea backing oot fra
t’ bargain noo, bud Ah aim ’at thoo war a larl bit
ti keen. Thoo sees it’s leyke this: t’ meer’s geean

other; ‘t’ cob’s deead altigither, an’ flayed.’</p>

<p>In the preceding five chapters, I have striven to
give you some insight into the character of our people.
This, however, has not been my only aim. I have
endeavoured—and shall continue to do so—to put the
dialect in such a way as to be easily mastered by my
readers, even should they be strangers to our county.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that the North and East
Ridings dialectically are the same. Certainly some
few words have been retained or dropped, as the
case may be, in each Riding, but the pronunciation
is identical, or at least almost so. These remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
however, do not hold good when applied to the West
Riding. Ripon (my native place) and Leeds are
not very far distant, only twenty-six miles. Ripon,
although in the West Riding, is to all intents
dialectically in the North, but by the time you have
travelled the twenty-six miles all is changed—you
have as it were crossed the line.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>CUSTOMS OF THE YEAR AND FOLKLORE</small></h2>


<p>Custom and folklore are so interwoven that it is
quite impossible to write of them separately. The
North Riding to-day is <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> the home
of both. This is easily accounted for. Many of the
dales are far removed from the varied influences of
the outer world; they are little communities; they
belong to themselves. Many of the older people
have never seen a locomotive. It is in and about
such places the student may gather a rich harvest
of folklore, always remembering that any given area is
not the whole of the riding, much less of Yorkshire.
I mention this because a custom, superstition, or
peculiarity of dialect, which may still flourish in one
dale, may be quite unknown in some other part of
the riding. Bear in mind the riding, within a very few
miles, stretches from the North Sea to St. George’s
Channel; so it will be readily conceived that over
such an extensive area, much of which is sparsely
populated and not easy of access, custom and superstition
still go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Our greatest observance of custom is, as it should
be, in connexion with Christmastide; indeed preparation
for the same really commences some weeks in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
advance. There is the pudding to make and partly
boil; all the ingredients for the plum-cake to order;
the mincemeat to prepare for the mince-pies; the
goose to choose from some neighbouring farmer’s
stock; the cheese to buy and the wheat to have the
hullins beaten off, and to cree, for the all-important
frumenty; the yule-cakes or pepper-cake to make; the
hollin to gather; the mistletoe and Santa Claus
presents to buy for the little folk’s stockings; the
old yule log and a new one to see after, as well as the
yule candles. Even long before these various duties
have been taken in hand, children nightly sing
their Christmas carols on our doorstep, reminding
us the great event of the year is fast approaching,
when peace and good will should be extended to all
men. The ’vessel-cups’ (i.e. wassail-cup) still come
round, with their doll in a box, decked out as the
Virgin Mary, lying in pink cotton-wool and evergreens.
Some of these vessel-cups are in their way
quite little works of art. I remember (up to the time
I left Guisborough five years ago) Lavinia Leather
travelled every year all the way from the other side
of Leeds, to sing the vessel-cup throughout that
part of Cleveland. As my wife had known the old
body for many years, we always had a call. There
was no mistaking the advent of Christmas, when, after
unceremoniously opening the door, the old lady
commenced saying,—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">God bless t’ maaster of this hoos,</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ t’ mis-ter-ess also,</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ all yer lahtle bonny bairns</div>
  <div class="verse">‘At round yer table go!</div>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Fer it is at this tahm</div>
  <div class="verse">Straangers travel far an’ near.</div>
  <div class="verse">Seea Ah wish ya a merry Kessamas</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ a happy New ‘Ear.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the days speed on, until there comes a night
when the charred remains of last year’s yule log
glow with heat intense beneath the one of that
year’s cutting; for the new log must always rest
upon and be lighted by the old one, which has been
carefully stored away for this, the night of nights—Christmas
Eve. The lads have kissed the lasses
under the mistletoe, fashioned out of two hoops
bedecked with holly, oranges, and apples, and with
a bunch of the mystic white berries glistening beneath.
Every picture-frame, ornament, and everywhere,
where a sprig of holly would remain, has had the
dark green leaves and red berries thrust into or
behind it. The old folk clasp each other’s hands,
knowingly nodding their heads the while, ‘for they
remember,’ and, remembering, note the flashing eyes
and whispered nothings, sweet and low, of those whose
horizon for the present is illumined with love, with
never a cloud in sight. Shrieks of laughter loud and
hilarious from the younger branches ring from basement
to roof, almost deafening the ’au’d fau’k,’ but
a smile lights up their wrinkled faces as they remember.
By-and-by, the magic words uttered by
the maid, ‘T’ frummety’s riddy,’ results in a rush
for the dining-room or kitchen, as the case may
be. But first the yule candle must be lighted by
the master of the house. This must be done from
a piece of the candle saved from the year previous;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
it too must be lighted from the blaze of the yule log,
and on no account must anything be lighted from it.
That would be as unlucky as giving or receiving a light
on Christmas Day. Next, a cross must be scraped
on the top of the uncut cheese, and then, after having
wished the guests assembled ‘A merry Christmas,’
the frumenty may be attacked. And very palatable
is the creed-wheat when boiled in milk, thickened
with ’lithing,’ seasoned with nutmeg and cloves, and
sweetened with treacle. After this there are the yule-cakes,
one for each person, with a dice of cheese and
a glass of mulled ale or hot elder-berry wine.</p>

<p>By-and-by the younger ones are packed off to bed,
and with us, as the world over, their stockings are
hung at the bed-foot to await the mysterious visit
of Santa Claus. It may be the sword-dancers are
announced; if so, their quaint performance is gone
through, they are served with ’summat to keep ’em
warm’ and a few coppers, and they depart for pastures
new<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>. Some maiden mayhap has retired to her chamber
with a leaf and a berry plucked from the mistletoe
under which she has been saluted. Having locked her
door, the berry must be swallowed, whilst on the
leaf she will prick the initials of him her heart loves
best; this she will stitch in the inside of her corset, so
that it rest near her heart, and thus bind his love
to her so long as there it remains.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the morning the waits will
arrive, and tunefully or otherwise sing ‘Christians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
awake,’ and, unless precautions are taken to stuff the
bell with paper and fasten down the knocker, there
will be no sleep after five o’clock; for the children, in
their eagerness to catch the early worm, follow one
another without a moment’s rest, singing loudly
through your key-hole one or other of their Christmas
greetings, as—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Gentle and simple herald Christmas morn<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> with
kindly greetings, ‘A merry Christmas to you,’ as they
pass. And oh the parties, night after night, the
games, postman’s knock, hunting the slipper, spinning
the trencher, cushion dance, forfeits, &amp;c.! Aye, but
we knew how to enjoy ourselves when I was a lad,
and in many of our dales to-day Christmas is Christmas
still, with all the old observances treasured; aye,
and the old old games too. Amidst such scenes
one is apt to forget that the hair is turning grey at
the sides, and easy to brush on the crown.</p>

<p>The Christmas dinner with its sirloin, turkey, or
goose, followed by the rich plum-pudding and mince-pies,
in a greater or less degree, is indulged in by all.
Go where you may on and after Christmas Day, either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
plum or pepper cake (a rich kind of gingerbread),
or spice-cake (a cheaper form of plum-cake) and
cheese, will be found upon the sideboard or table.
‘Ya mun ’ev a bit o’ keeak an’ cheese, hooivver,’ say
the country folk almost before you are seated. And
be it remembered, for every cake and cheese you
taste one more happy month is added to your life.</p>

<p>On St. Stephen’s Eve maybe some will pay a visit
to the ’coo byre’ in the hope of seeing the oxen
kneel, for the quaint notion still lives that on this
eve the oxen kneel in their stalls in commemoration
of the martyr’s death.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve it is customary to eat the
remains of the frumenty left from Christmas Eve.
This being finished, none other will be made until the
festive season comes round again. The older people
always watch the old year out and the new year in,
which is made known by the ringing of the church
bells, and the loud knocking at your door of the
‘first foot or lucky bird.’ This happens immediately
on the last stroke of twelve. This first foot to cross your
threshold—for none must go out until the first foot
has come in—must be a man or boy with dark hair.
Such only can bring luck to the household; for should
he have light hair, he would not be admitted, for he
could only bring dire and disastrous results.</p>

<p>The same clamorous singing as on Christmas Day
commences just as early on New Year’s morn,
greetings for the new year are as freely given, and the
festive season itself lasts pretty well on towards the
middle of the month.</p>

<p>The dumb-cake is yet made—of which more here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>after—whilst
other rites, ceremonies, and charms are
still indulged in by the buxom lasses of the riding.</p>

<p>By due observance of certain ritual performed on
the eve of St. Agnes, a maiden might have a vision
of her future spouse.</p>

<p>Very often, however, difficulties of no light kind
had to be overcome, before the ritual could be carried
out in its entirety. And in some cases, to my
thinking, the maiden would need nerves of iron, and
the supple limbs of an acrobat, before she would be
able to accomplish the demands made upon her.</p>

<p>Take for example the following, which was given
to me by an old lady in Rosedale:—At midnight on
the eve of St. Agnes, a maiden must pluck from
the grave of a bachelor a blade of grass, walk backward
from the grave to the church gate, and then
hurry to her bed-chamber. Safely there, she had to
lock her door, hanging the key on a nail outside
the window, then undress herself; but—and here
comes the difficulty—her various garments had to
be removed in the same order as they had been
put on, that is, that which she had donned first must
be taken off first. This must have been a feat
requiring great agility and no little patience, exceeding
by a long way the task of skinning an eel in
the dark. No doubt everything would be worn very
loosely that day, and any undue exertion must have
rendered such a maid liable any moment to assume
the condition of a statue. Of one thing I am absolutely
certain: did the maid accomplish the feat
so far as her skirts and other items of her apparel
are concerned, she would have to sleep with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
boots on, for her stockings would present a problem
which jeers at the senile efforts of the Sphinx. But,
having performed the said ritual so far, it only
remained for her to wrap the blade of grass in a clean
sheet of paper, place it under her pillow, leave a
burning candle near the window, and retire to rest,
when presently she would see the man who was to
be her husband open the window, look in, throw the
key into the room, close the window, and depart.
Where the chamber was on the ground floor, or
ladders were handy, I can well understand this
ritual would often succeed.</p>

<p>Maidens, however, may have a vision of their future
lord and master(?) without the necessity of almost
dislocating their joints. For I find at the present
time it is only needful, on the day of the eve of
St. Agnes, to fast from the time of rising, only eating
a little stale bread and drinking parsley tea. On
retiring to rest, remake your bed, putting thereon
clean sheets and pillow-cases, remembering to repeat
as you lay on each cover the following:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">St. Agnes, I pray unto thee,</div>
  <div class="verse">I, a maid, would married be,</div>
  <div class="verse">So thou my husband show to me.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Retire to rest, sleeping by yourself, and you will
see the man you will marry in a dream. Should you
awake, my advice is—having seen the future husband,
get up and have a good supper; parsley tea and stale
bread for a day is not satisfying. There are other forms
of the same charm, differing only in minor details.</p>

<p>The making of the dumb-cake, however, differs
only in one particular throughout the riding. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
hold that those engaged in its preparation must stand
on something upon which they have never stood
before, no two persons standing on a similar thing,
e.g. a box-lid, a newspaper, &amp;c. Others altogether
ignore this canon in the ritual. Therefore I must
leave my fair readers to decide which formula they
will adopt, in case they decide to make a dumb-cake
for themselves. As to the actual preparation, it
must be begun after eleven o’clock p.m. on the eve of
St. Agnes, and either three, five, or seven maidens may
take part. In the making of a dumb-cake, each must
take a handful of flour and lay it on a sheet of clean
paper (this must be pretty large), bearing in mind that
from the moment the first hand is dipped in the flour,
not a word must be uttered whilst the cake-makers
remain in that room, or the spell will be broken.</p>

<p>Having each laid a handful of flour on the sheet
of paper, all add a small pinch of salt, water being
also added, all taking part in working the same into
dough, every one kneading and assisting in rolling
the same into a thin cake, sufficiently large for each
to mark her initials in fairly large letters thereon. All
must now lend a hand in lifting it on to a tin, and
in carrying it to the fire, in front of which it must be
laid. Having seated themselves as far from the fire
as possible, each will in turn rise, cross the room, and
turn the cake round once—not over, as it must be
left the inscribed side uppermost. All this having
been accomplished before twelve strikes, remain
quietly seated; for, a few minutes after midnight,
the husband of the maiden who is to be married first
will appear and touch her initials, often leaving his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
fingermark upon the same. So there can be no
doubt about it.</p>

<p>Should you have no opportunity of joining others
in the preparation of a dumb-cake, you may, if so
inclined, on the Friday evening following that of
St. Agnes (some say any Friday but Good Friday),
have a vision of your future husband by a strict
observance of the following:—</p>

<p>Make a flat dough cake about the size of a crown
piece; on this prick the initials of the one you secretly
love. Next procure three small keys, all different, and
make an impression of each on the underside of the
cake. On retiring to rest, thread the three keys on
the garter of your left leg, wrapping the same about
the little cake; stitch this ball to the inside of your
nightdress so that it will rest in the centre of your
bosom, and you will then dream, either of the man you
love, or some other swain. If not of the one you love,
then your affections for the present are misplaced.</p>

<p>The days in Holy Week are familiarly known
as Collop Monday, Pancake Tuesday, Frutas or
Fritters Wednesday, Bloody Thorsday,</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">An’ Lang Friday ’at’s nivver deean,</div>
  <div class="verse">Seea lig i’ bed whahl Seterdaay neean.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The usual menu for the week is still pretty much
as it was. Collops of bacon and fried eggs on Monday.
Pancakes served with either treacle or lemon-juice
and sugar on Tuesday. Frutas, or fritters, made from
a light kind of tea-cake paste, only much richer in fruit
and fried either in lard or butter, on Wednesday;
and, with many of humble degree, black puddings
on Thursday. Whilst on Friday, fast is kept on any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
frutas which may have been spared from Wednesday’s
feast, and there always is a very considerable helping
left over.</p>

<p>Paste-egg or Troll-egg<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Day, is now celebrated on
Easter Monday, but in days past Easter Day and
Paste-egg Day were one. At the present time the
last five Sundays of Lent and Easter Day are still
called Tid, Mid, Miseray, Carlin’, and Paum, an’
Paste-egg Day. There is some uncertainty as to what
Tid and Mid mean, but there can be no doubt that
Miseray is a corruption of Miserere, the commencement
of one of the psalms ordered to be read during Lent.
The whole of the names, however, take us back to
mediaeval times, and though some are inclined to
think that Tid means ‘Te Deum’ and Mid ‘Mid
Lent,’ it seems to me careful research will in time give
a more plausible solution. Carling Sunday is still
observed in many places, grey peas fried with bacon or
in butter being a well-known dish on that day, many
even carrying a goodly store about in paper bags.
At Great Ayton, and in many parts of Cleveland,
Carling Sunday is still fully observed. The same is
equally true of Palm Sunday, or, as it is called, ‘Paum
Sunda,’ catkins, or lambs’ tails, as they are universally
designated, being carried in the hand, thrust in the
buttonhole, or worn in the hat, whilst many a mantelpiece
and ornament is often tastefully decorated
with the same. From noon on Easter Day to noon
the following day, an old custom which is now only
kept up in remote villages, but which was quite
general throughout the riding when I was a lad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
was that of one or more young fellows seizing a
female and forcibly pulling off her shoe, sometimes
both, laces being no protection. These were held in
bondage until a fine was paid. This very rough
proceeding was formerly known as ’buckle-snatching,’
the old name for the theft during the days when
buckles were worn. However, if the lads had their
good time from the Sunday to Monday’s noon, the
lasses did not fail to retaliate from that time until noon
on Tuesday. From any hidden corner or doorway,
out they rushed, and rarely failed to snatch either
a hat, whip, stick, handkerchief, or something, they
were not particular what, or to scratching either,
generally managing to recuperate themselves for any
losses of the day previous. On Easter Monday the
bairns hie themselves to some field and roll or troll their
hard-boiled eggs dyed in many colours; this lasts
until the egg is broken, when the youngsters feed
upon the contents. Many of the lads, however, have
a much speedier method of either adding to their
store of food or losing their egg. They jaup or jarp
them together, i.e. one lad strikes his egg against that
of his opponent, when one or both are broken; if
only one, it is forfeited and becomes the property of
the conqueror. Shuttlecock and battledoor is now
greatly <i lang="fr">en evidence</i> with the girls, and knur and spell
with the lads. One might well, and with profit, write
a chapter on the sequence of games, but such comes
hardly within the scope of this work. But here and
there a few will be noted when they have attached
to them special peculiarities.</p>

<p>There is an old custom, almost dead now. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
only in hidden and unfrequented spots that it still
survives—I mean ’the wading of the sun.’ It was
common enough thirty years ago. The <i lang="la">modus
operandi</i> was as follows:—As the sun rose on Easter
morn, a bucket of water was placed in such a position
that the sun was reflected in it. If the sun waded,
i.e. glimmered in the water, it would rain that day;
but if it kept fine in the morning and rained in the
afternoon, then the spring would be fine and the
autumn wet, and vice versa. On this morning too
the flight of the crows was carefully observed; if
they settled near home, instead of flying far afield
to feed, the farmer shook his head, for they plainly
told him, by so doing, that grub and other pests
would sorely afflict his crops that year.</p>

<p>Friday is looked upon as an unlucky day to
commence or conclude any undertaking. It is considered
unlucky for the first lamb to be dropped on
a Friday, to begin sowing or reaping, or to lead the
last load on that day. Should the weather be very
threatening, instead of finishing leading on the Friday,
one stook is very often left, and not brought in until
the following day.</p>

<p>Of St. Valentine’s Day we might truly write, ‘Poor
St. Valentine! for with thee it is Ichabod.’ No longer
do we find shop windows filled with works of art,
wrought in silver, lace, and gold; no longer within
a coral bower, hung with icicles and rosebuds, is the
maiden’s hand clasped or waist encircled; no longer
does a pathway of powdered fish-scales lead direct
to the little church seen in the far distance, whilst the
overfed cupid, who managed to sit on the edge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
a very thin cloud, must have fallen off and decamped
with the couple of skewered hearts which were usually
floating at their own sweet will ’mid heaven. Hearts
are at a discount now. Fifty years ago, love-making
was a very real and somewhat pedantic proceeding;
in these days, when time is money, the whole thing
has been curtailed. It is—cut the dialogue and come
to the bank book.</p>

<p>Why, there was a time, and only a few years ago,
when as many pounds were spent on these love tokens
as pennies now.</p>

<p>There may be, here and there, a maiden left who,
before retiring to rest, splits a holly twig and binds
within the split part a small slip of paper, upon which
she has written, with her heart’s blood, the name of
him she loveth best, and who places the same under her
pillow, so that she may dream her fate. There may
be, but I doubt it. Their grandmothers did, though.</p>

<p>Valentine’s Day may be dead, but April Fools’ Day
is still with us. ‘Makking t’ feeal o’ yan’ is yet
common. The last sell I heard of was sending a lad
from one place to another for a bucket of steam. I
wonder how long ago it is since the first boy was
sent for ’a penn’orth o’ strap oil’ or ’a pint ov pigeon’s
milk,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>On Good Friday it is considered impious to dig or
plough.</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">On Good Friday rist thi pleeaf;</div>
  <div class="verse">Start nowt, end nowt, that’s eneeaf.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Perhaps one of the oldest customs is that in connexion
with St. Mark’s Eve. The belief is still held
that those who watch the church porch at the hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of midnight on that eve, will see pass in front of
them and enter the church the spirits of all those
friends who will die during the coming year. With
some it is held to be a <i lang="la">sine qua non</i> that the
watcher must sit within the porch; whilst others hold
four cross roads to be equally efficacious, always
provided that the body of one who had committed
suicide, with the orthodox stake driven through the
chest, had been buried there, that being the end of
suicides in the good old days.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that there are two slight
penalties attached to this porch or cross-road watching.</p>

<p>Firstly, should the watcher fall asleep, there is
every probability of its being the sleep of death.
Should he, however, manage to awaken from such a
lethargic slumber, it doesn’t amount to much, as he
will assuredly die within the next twelve months.
Secondly, whoever tries this game once must continue
to do so ever afterwards. There is no escape; the
spell upon them is said to be too strong to withstand.</p>

<p>Said an old fellow at Carthorpe, ‘Ah nivver
watched mysen, bud one James Haw used ti watch
t’ deead gan in an’ cum oot o’ Bon’iston Chetch ivvery
St. Mark Eve ez it cam roond. He ’ed teea; he war

mud he ’a’e kenn’d whau tha war? They all passed
cleease tiv him, bud neean on ’em ivver gav’ him a nod,
na nowt o’ that soart. Bud,’ added he, almost in
a whisper, ‘them ’at duz it yance awlus ’ev ti deea’t;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
tha cann’t ho’d thersens back, they’re forced ti gan

a despert thing ti ’a’e ti deea, ’coz ya ’a’e ti gan,
whahl at t’ last end ya see yersen pass yersen,
an’ then ya knaw ’at yer tahm’s cum’d an’ ‘at ya’ll
be laid i’ t’ cau’d grund afoor that daay cum twelve-month.’</p>

<p>There was another method of divination very
commonly resorted to, known by the name of ’caff
riddling’ (chaff riddling). The rite was carried out
as follows:—At midnight, with the barn doors thrown
wide open, a quantity of chaff had to be riddled,
those taking part in the ceremony riddling in turn;
should a coffin pass the door whilst any one was working
the sieve, that person would die within the year.
A story is still current in Malton of a woman who
tried the above divination. It would seem, some
little time after she had commenced to riddle, two
men passed the open doors carrying a coffin, and on
those who were with her rushing outside to see where
they went, neither men nor coffin were anywhere to
be seen. Only the woman saw the coffin. It is on
record that she died within the year. The occurrence
took place about forty years ago.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are a trifle more superstitious than some
other counties, but it must be borne in mind that
a wealth of folklore adds great respectability to a
genealogy which dates back to times so far remote,
that the rites and ceremonies of the religion from
which it sprang must now be sought for in the myth-history
of other lands.</p>

<p>In connexion with Royal Oak Day took place the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
locking out of the schoolmaster by the scholars,
loudly singing, whilst they held the fortress—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">It’s Royal Oak daay,</div>
  <div class="verse">T’ twenty-nahnth o’ Maay,</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ if ya deean’t gi’e uz hollida</div>
  <div class="verse">Wa’ll all run awaay.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The above was sung, to the entire satisfaction of the
lads, a couple of years ago at Great Ayton. On this
day it is customary for every one to display a twig of
oak; should any one be so remiss as to walk abroad
without sporting an oak-leaf or two, it is quite
probable some urchin may give the delinquent a
sharp reminder by switching him over the hand with
a nettle. And woe betide the lad who is so foolhardy
as to venture forth oakless, for in addition to
being stung with nettles, he may have to submit to
being rubbed over with chalk until he looks very
like a miller. It may be mentioned that Royal Oak
Day is often called Chalky-back Day.</p>

<p>There are several charms and ceremonies peculiar
to Midsummer Eve, the careful observance of which
enables a maiden to learn something of what fate may
have in store for her. Does she doubt the constancy
of her lover, she can satisfy herself once for all, no
matter what other folk may say, and in spite of anything
she may have seen or imagined herself, by
observing the following rite. Certainly the carrying
out of the ceremony is a wee bit troublesome, but of
what account is trouble when such vital points are at
issue as the unmasking of perfidy or the establishment
of truth and love? To perform the rite the maiden
must proceed as follows:—Pull three hairs from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
tail of a perfectly black cat, also three from a red cow;
gather three leaves of the deadly nightshade, and,
having killed a white pigeon, smear each leaf with
blood from its heart. Now make three flat parcels,
each containing a cat’s hair, a cow’s hair, and a leaf.
Next stew the pigeon, saving the gravy. Now make
a savoury dish, adding thereto the gravy. The suspected
one must be asked to supper on Midsummer
Eve, the damsel being careful to place under the tablecloth
the three parcels, in such manner that one will
lie under his plate, one under the dish containing
the gravy, and the third under her own plate. During
supper, should her lover find the least fault with any
person or thing, he is faithless. If the maiden is
very deeply in love, I should advise her to do most of
the talking; let it be only a one-course supper, and
hurry through with it. The above charm is rarely resorted
to now; the several difficulties which have to be
overcome before it can be successfully carried out,
have almost laid it on one side. But I well remember
its being tried years ago by one of our servants, and
I have been informed that it was resorted to, inside of
the last five years, at a farm-house near Swainby.</p>

<p>Here is another one for the same eve, which is
much more widely known, and believed in yet by
many. Three maids, unseen by and unknown to any
other but themselves, must each gather a sprig of
rosemary, and between the hours of eleven and twelve
p.m. retire to an upper chamber, lock the door, and
from the moment the key is turned not a word must
be spoken. Near one end of the room a basin half
full of water must be placed, in which each maiden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
has dropped a handful of red-rose leaves; the three
sprigs of rosemary must now be laid on the rose
leaves; next, fix a line across the room, over which
each must throw—not fasten in any way—a chemise
of her own make, but which she has never worn.
Having thus arranged matters, they must seat themselves
as far from the basin as possible, when they
will be shortly rewarded, for a few moments after
twelve o’clock the husband of each will appear.
There can be no doubt about this, because each
apparition will seize a sprig of rosemary and sprinkle
the chemise of the girl he loves. Nothing could be
more convincing than this; now, could there be?</p>

<p>If not yet fully satisfied, they may make another
attempt on the eve of St. Mary Magdalene. For this
they will have to prepare the following decoction:—Take
a wineglassful each of rum, gin, and red wine, a
teaspoonful of honey, treacle, and sugar, and the same
of vinegar, lemon-juice, and sour oranges; these must
be mixed together in some utensil purchased that
day, and for which each must pay an equal share.
When mixing the ingredients, the following rule must
be observed: the first maiden must pour in the spirits
and wine, the second the sweets, and the third the sours;
this must be done at the hour of midnight. Let each
now take a sprig of rosemary, dip it in the liquor, and
then carefully stitch the same securely to the bosom
of her nightdress; bear in mind you are an old maid
for ever if you and your sprig part company during
the night. Each in turn must now drink a tablespoonful
of the mixture, until every drop is consumed,
then jump into bed, all three together, and on falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
asleep, each maiden will have a dream, the meaning
of which cannot be misunderstood. This seems to be
quite certain, and there is another thing equally
assured—one and all will awake with such a splitting
headache in the morning, that they will forswear
improvised cold punch for ever afterwards.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of this work to take note
of purely local customs, deeply interesting though they
be. Therefore the Vardy dinner at Helmsley, the
procession of the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of
York at Kilburn, the race up the hill at Askrigg, or the
May-pole dances at several other places, and the like,
must be passed over.</p>

<p>The mell supper, though lacking much of its pristine
glory, is still with us. Mr. Robinson of Carthorpe,
and many others in the riding, still keep to the good
old ways. The mell supper, i.e. a supper and a dance
after the ingathering of the harvest, is exceedingly
common, but with its older observances, or at least
as many of them as are remembered, is only adhered
to here and there. Still, at the present day, something
of the old-time doings are to be met with.
The last sheaf at Carthorpe, as in Jutland, is called
the ’widow,’ and the last load is always led triumphantly
home with songs of joy.</p>

<p>In many places it is common for the last few
sheaves to be bound together, these being decorated
with ribbons and handkerchiefs—the women racing
for the ribbons, and the men contending for the
handkerchiefs. This, of course, is a survival of the time
when the sheaves themselves were run for; and in the
days when an additional bushel of grain was a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
greatly to be desired, the prize would be not a little
coveted. Here and there the mell doll is still made;
certainly it is not now bedecked with all the gaudy
trappings it was adorned with in days of yore, but
often some skilful hand will plait the straw into
fantastical shapes, exhibiting considerable artistic
taste and skill. When completed, whether it be in
the form of a doll<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> or that of some other device, it
still goes by the name of ’t’ mell doll,’ and is placed
in the centre of the barn, round which, by-and-by, the
guests will trip on the light fantastic toe.</p>

<p>One characteristic of the mell supper, so far as I
know, is now a thing of the past, i.e. the guisers.
These were a kind of sword-dancers, who twenty
years ago generally came as unbidden guests after
the dancing had commenced; as a rule they were
accorded a hearty welcome, as they added greatly
to the merriment of the evening’s revel, for as the
cake and ale went round, the excitement increased,
songs and shouting became general, and the dancing
something after the nature of a stampede, till at last
the uproar was general. It is at such times when age
forgets its years, and the young let slip the tether
of their youthful spirits, and romp—aye, romp;
for the ale is good, the lasses are bonny, ‘slim o’
waist and leet o’ foot.’ It is Yorkshire, all Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The fifth of November, with its bonfires and Guy
Fawkes, is as religiously observed in the riding as in
any other part of the country. Over a wide area it
is the festive occasion on which every good wife bakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
a store of parkin, its general form being that of a flat
cake of gingerbread, the recipe varying according to
the means of the house.</p>

<p>In the days when there were no county police, if
not wise enough to securely lock up your yard broom,
of a certainty it would be stolen; and if ever you did
see it again, it would be on the evening of the fifth,
soaked with tar, in the hands of some fellow rushing
like a mad thing along the street with your property
blazing in front of him. I have known of scores of
brooms which were stolen—aye, and stolen them
myself—but I do not recollect an instance of the thief
being prosecuted. No, if you did not secure your
broom, it went, and that was very much the end
of it. There was more fun running with a stolen
besom than a bought one.</p>

<p>Quite an interesting collection of doggerel verses
might be given, which the lads in various parts sing
when dragging their load of sticks and thorns to the
site of the bonfire. I give one, which an old inhabitant
of Great Ayton tells me was sung when his
grandfather was a boy.</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>Within a week, the young carol-singers will be on
your doorstep night after night, reminding you that
Christmas is drawing nigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>A very old custom, but which has now been pretty
nigh stamped out by the county policeman, is that
of ‘Riding the Stang.’ It is not dead yet, though;
I witnessed the stang being ridden as recently as
1891 in Guisborough, and in many of the villages in
Wensleydale it is to this day resorted to when considered
needful.</p>

<p>The stang is held in wholesome dread by a certain
class of evil-doers. Wife-beaters and immoral characters
chiefly had and have the benefit of the stang<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.
Whatever their discovered sin might be, was fully set
forth in the stang doggerel. One or two points have
to be, or at least are, most carefully observed: (1) The
real name of the culprit must not be mentioned.
(2) The stang must be ridden in three separate parishes
each night; and in many places, to make the proceedings
quite legal, it was considered a <i lang="la">sine qua non</i> that
the stang-master must knock at the door of the man
or woman they were holding up to ridicule, and ask
for a pocket-piece, i.e. fourpence.</p>

<p>The whole proceeding was carried out as follows:—An
effigy made of straw and old clothes, representing
the culprit, was bound to a pole<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and set in an
upright position in the centre of either a handcart or
a small pony cart, in which was seated the stang-master;
and following behind were gathered all the
ragamuffins of the village, armed with pan lids, tin
cans, tin whistles, or anything which could be made to
produce a discordant sound. Being ready, the cart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
was drawn in front of the culprit’s house, and after
a fearful hubbub, the stang-master cried out, in a sing-song
voice,—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ah tinkle, Ah tinkle, Ah tinkle tang,</div>
  <div class="verse">It’s nut foor your part ner mah part</div>
  <div class="verse">‘At Ah rahd the stang,</div>
  <div class="verse">Bud foor yan Bill Switch whau his weyfe did bang,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ah tinkle, Ah tinkle, Ah tinkle tang.</div>
  <div class="verse">He banged her, he banged her, he banged her indeed,</div>
  <div class="verse">He banged her, he banged her, afoor sha steead need;</div>
  <div class="verse">Upstairs aback o’ t’ bed</div>
  <div class="verse">He sairly brayed her whahl sha bled,</div>
  <div class="verse">Oot o’ t’ hoos on ti t’ green,</div>
  <div class="verse">Sikan a seet ez nivver war seen,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ez neean c’u’d think, ez neean c’u’d dream.</div>
  <div class="verse">Sae Ah gat ma a few cumarades</div>
  <div class="verse">Ti traal ma aboot;</div>
  <div class="verse">Sae it’s hip hip hurrah, lads,</div>
  <div class="verse">Set up a gert shoot,</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ blaw all yer whistles,</div>
  <div class="verse">Screeam, rattle, an’ bang</div>
  <div class="verse">All ’at ivver ya’ve gitten,</div>
  <div class="verse">Foor Ah ride the stang.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then, for a few moments, there arose a tumult of
sound, to which the wildest ravings of bedlam would
seem insignificant.</p>

<p>This performance lasts three nights, and on the
third the effigy is burnt in front of the culprit’s
house.</p>

<p>Another very old custom, which is now rarely seen,
is that of bottle breaking. When a house was ready
for the thatch, in later days the tiles, a bottle was
suspended by a ribbon from the ridge beam. Stones
were then shied at it, and the one who was lucky enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
to smash the bottle claimed the ribbon. If in days
past this custom had anything of an occult nature
attached to it, it has long ago been forgotten. In its
last days it degenerated into what was considered to
be a valid excuse for spending the rest of the day in
the village pub. <i lang="la">O tempora, O mores!</i></p>

<p>The daily life of the Guisboreans does not seem to
have altered much from the time of Edward VI to the
end of last century. In a letter among the Cottonian
MSS., the writer, addressing Sir Thomas Chaloner,
says, ‘The people bread here (Guisborough) live very
longe, if they be a while absent they growe sicklye;
they are altogether given to pleasure, scarce any good
husband amongst them; Day and Nighte feastinge,
making Matches for Horse Races, Dog runninge, or
runninge on Foote,’ &amp;c. The above was written
about 1550, and we find in 1784 that things were
still pretty lively, as the contents of the small hand-bill<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
(see next page) fully testify. The contents
of another, setting forth the varied attractions of
‘Staithes Feast,’ are also characteristic of the time.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>CUSTOMS OF COURTSHIP, MARRIAGE, BIRTH,
AND DEATH</small></h2>


<h3><i>Superstition.</i></h3>

<p>The old customs and superstitions connected with
marriage festivities are perhaps more closely observed
here and there in the North Riding than in any
other part of Yorkshire. In some parts of Cleveland,
I doubt if the bride and bridegroom would consider
themselves properly wedded if there were no race
for a ribbon or handkerchief. And certainly it
would be a most unlucky omen, should any one
but the bride cut the first piece from the bride’s
cake. But I anticipate—let us commence at the
beginning. Very rarely, I imagine, is it that an
orthodox proposal is ever made by a Yorkshire lad
to the lass of his choice. No, they just ’keep
cump’ny t’ ane wi’ t’ t’other.’ ‘Keeping company’ is
the Yorkshire idiom for courting; and during that
happy time, in days past, were a young fellow ever
caught kissing his lady-love whilst a roof was over
their heads (i. e. in any one’s house), he was liable—if
he did not instantly throw on the table kiss-money—to
be ‘pitchered<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>’ on the spot, i.e. either have a hole
burnt through his coat or his buttons cut off. This
violent attack on the person of arson and robbery was
usually effected by a bevy of damsels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>In time, if all went well, the twain decided to
become one; to this end the ’spurrings’ were put in,
i.e. the banns were published. This having been
accomplished, the couple were said to be ’hanging
in the bell-ropes’—no maiden would ever think of
attending church during the time she was hanging in
the bell-ropes, or to use another expression, ‘whilst
she was suffering from a broken leg after having
tumm’l’d ower t’ bauk.’</p>

<p>The wedding day having arrived, the happy couple,
accompanied by their friends, either proceed two and
two, or hire a cab.</p>

<p>Of course the bride is properly garnished for the
occasion, and very nice and blushy she looks—that
goes without saying. But whatever her toilet may
be, one thing is certain—not a speck of blue or green
will be found anywhere about her, both colours being
considered very unlucky; neither will the wedding
take place on a Friday.</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Deean’t o’ Friday buy yer ring,</div>
  <div class="verse">O’ Friday deean’t put t’ spurrings in,</div>
  <div class="verse">Deean’t wed o’ Friday. Think on o’ this,</div>
  <div class="verse">Nowther blue ner green mun match her dhriss.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>If during the ceremony the sun is obscured for
a short time, and then bursts forth shining on the
couple, happy will such a bride be. For</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Blessed is t’ bride ’at t’ sun shines on,</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ blessed is t’ deead ’at t’ rain rains on.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Years ago, it was the custom, in many parts of
Cleveland, for the bride and bridegroom to leap over
a form on leaving the church porch. On this feat
being accomplished, a gun was fired, this often being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
charged with feathers. At Guisborough the firing
of guns was continued throughout the whole route.
And in many parts of Cleveland, meeting the bridal
procession with hot pots was common; these were
bowls filled with a kind of steaming punch, and as
the bridal party were expected to drink from every
hot pot, one can well imagine and understand the
revelry which so often took place, especially when
the hot pots were numerous. Afterwards, these pots
were carried from door to door, a plate covered with
a saucer being also presented; a gift of money was
slipped under the saucer, given to enable the hot pot
to be replenished. In the Staithes district, if a guest
stepped in any kind of filth on his or her way to the
house, on no account would it be wiped off, it being
considered very unlucky to do so. I believe, at that
time, sanded floors and not carpets were the rule.</p>

<p>On passing through the church gates, the bridegroom
usually threw a handful of coppers amongst the crowd.
A man now headed the procession, carrying under
his arm a young cockerel, which he made continually
to ‘skrike oot’; this could only be silenced by the
payment of bride’s money. On arriving at the bride’s
home, she was met on the doorstep, and presented
with a small cake on a plate. A little of this she
would eat, throwing the remainder over her head,
typical of the hope that they might always have
plenty and something to spare. She then handed the
plate to her husband; this he threw over his head, their
future happiness depending upon its being broken<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>The race for the bride’s garter was a common
custom in former times, its possession being held in
high esteem, and valued as a potent love charm.</p>

<p>Now, however, the custom has almost fallen into
disuse, though within the last five years the ceremony
was fully carried out. At one time it was not only
a recognized custom, but in most cases special
preparation was made for its due observance, the
maidens spending no little time and skill in the
working of their bridal garters.</p>

<p>Immediately after the plate had been broken, the
bride’s attempt to cross the threshold was hindered
by the kneeling figure of the winner of the race,
claiming the privilege of removing the prize. The
bride then raised her skirt whilst he removed the
valued trophy<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.</p>

<p>As it was the correct thing in those good old days
for ladies to raise the skirt quite as high when dancing,
and as elaborately worked stockings were worn to be
looked at, nothing was thought of lifting the skirt,
and nothing would in these days if some lady of
title revived the custom. From an old rhyme, I give
the following lines:—</p>

the garter of their lady-love about their sword-hilts.</p>

<p>The following lines evidently were written when
the bridal garter was held in greater favour than the

<p>Originally the ceremony of removing the bridal
garter was, as has been said, carried out in a perfectly
decorous manner; in time, however, it degenerated into
actually stealing the garter by force. This unseemly
proceeding possibly arose from the strong opposition
and resentment which was felt, and for long demonstrated,
whenever the ribbon supplanted the garter.</p>

<p>Why, as recently as 1820, Lady —— <a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>, a great
stickler after old customs, on stepping from her
bridal coach, inquired who had won the race. ‘Ah
did, my lady,’ answered one of the stable lads.
Ascending the steps, her ladyship stepped half over
the threshold, calling out to the lad, ‘Come, Tom,
and claim your prize,’ adding, as she raised her
silken gown, ‘I intend to be properly married and
have the luck I am entitled to.’ Then turning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the young fellow, smiling, she added, ‘Take it off,
Tom, and give it to your sweetheart, and may it
bring luck to both of you.’</p>

<p>In Great Ayton the ribbon seems to have supplanted
the garter in the early part of this century. In fact
it is only the old folks who remember, and can tell
you anything concerning the gay and festive doings
of those days. But the older custom held its own
for long afterwards, and that, too, within a very few
miles. But intercommunication between villages has
never been a strong feature. Even to-day there is
a species of rivalry existing between Stokesley and
Great Ayton people, but this is common to all
adjacent villages.</p>

<p>It only adds one more proof in support of what has
already been said, that the customs, superstitions, and
dialect of any given locality, or even that of a whole
dale, cannot, and must not, be taken as being that
of the whole of the North Riding, much less of
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>A case in point may here be mentioned. In days
past it was usual in Great Ayton to discharge firearms
over the bridal party as they processed both <em>to and
from the church</em>. This, however, was by no means
the custom throughout Cleveland<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>. Neither was
the firing of the stithy, which I am told was never
omitted; i.e. a charge of powder poured into a hole
in the anvil, upon which a heavy weight was laid;
this, when fired, went off with the report of a cannon.
In many places the latter was only resorted to when
either objectionable people were united or in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
case of a forced marriage. In Great Ayton it was
done in honour of the occasion.</p>

<p>Much variation exists as to the exact time when
the ribbon is to be run for. In some places it is the
custom for the racers to stand at the church door,
and start off on a signal being given that the ring has
been slipped on the bride’s finger. In other localities
the race takes place the moment the bride and
bridegroom leave the church porch, the one arriving
first at the bride’s door being the winner.</p>

<p>In other localities it does not take place until after
the wedding feast, and again, often not until evening.</p>

<p>In many places it is customary for the bride to
stand as the winning post, holding the ribbon in her
hand, the winner not only claiming the prize, but
a kiss also. It may be mentioned here that the best
man generally claims the first kiss at the conclusion
of the ceremony. At Great Ayton and many other
places sixty years ago, before the bride left the altar
steps the sexton removed her shoe, which was
ransomed by the bridegroom. It was, and is still,
considered most lucky to rub shoulders with the bridegroom.
And until somewhat recently the parson
officiating was always expected to kiss the bride.
Before railways were so general, and when, as often
happened, the honeymoon had to be spent amongst
friends within driving distance, or at the bride’s home,
‘throwing the stocking’ at the bride and bridegroom
after they had retired to rest was never omitted.</p>

<p>It is a bad omen should the bridal party meet
a coffin, or should a cripple cross their path. Had
they to pass over a stream, it was usual for both to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
throw something over their shoulder into the stream,
saying as they did so, ‘Bad luck cleave to you,’ being
very careful not to set eyes on the object again. On
an occasion of this kind, should the man wish to be
master in his own house, he had better see that he
cross the centre of the bridge a little in advance of
his bride, or that lady will gain an advantage she will
be careful not to undervalue—the husband will have
to do the wife’s bidding. It is also considered unlucky
to remove the wedding ring before the birth of the
first child. Should a bride unfortunately do so, be
sure it is the husband who replaces it; on no account
must she let another man do so, unless she wishes
speedily to become a widow. Before the bride and
bridegroom left for their own home, it was common
for a kettleful of boiling water to be poured on the
front step, upon which the bride stepped, being careful
to wet both her shoes. The due observance of this
custom ensured another happy marriage being arranged
amongst the company there assembled.</p>

<p>When the time arrives for the happy couple to
take their departure, either for their own home or
the honeymoon, great care must be observed that the
husband steps over the threshold in front of his bride,
otherwise she will take the lead in all things through
life. It would be a great advantage to a lot of men
if the wife did step a little in advance. They must
also be very careful not to make their exit with the
back and front door open at the same time; and on
entering their new home, a man must receive them,
never a woman, neither must they enter an empty
house, as it would result in a lack of friends. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
belief in open doors, &amp;c., applies to all occasions when
leaving or returning home after having spent the
night under a strange roof. As the bride leaves the
paternal roof, some swain will endeavour to seize her
foot. This doubtless is a surviving relic of the time
when it was deemed a post of honour to assist the
bride into the saddle. It ensures little separation
through life if the happy pair, on rising from their
bridal couch, take each other by the hand, and slip
out of bed, so that their feet touch the floor together;
then, still keeping hold of hands, they must cross the
room and step outside, as equally as possible.</p>

<p>Whilst the immediate friends enjoyed themselves
as guests at the bride’s house, many of their well-wishers
adjourned to the nearest hostel and drank
their healths with many a glass and catch-song.</p>

<p>One, a kind of catch-verse, was very common a few
years ago. Each time it was sung the glasses were
drained, some one else being called upon to repeat the
song. This had to be done at once, and in the
reverse way to the former vocalist, i.e. if the last
singer toasted the bridegroom, the next must commence
with the bride; did he make a mistake, he had
to pay for glasses round.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Verse.</i></p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The brahdgroom’s health we all will sing,</div>
  <div class="verse">In spite of Turk or Spanish king,</div>
  <div class="verse">The brahd’s good health we will not pass,</div>
  <div class="verse">But put them both into one glass.</div>
  <div class="verse">See, see, see that he drink it all,</div>
  <div class="verse">See, see, see that he let none fall,</div>
  <div class="verse">For if he do, he shall drink two,</div>
  <div class="verse">And so shall the rest of the company do.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>
<p>Another catch-rhyme must have resulted in innumerable
glasses having to be paid for each time it was sung.
It was quite an action song, each taking a line in turn,
every glass being raised at the commencement of each
line, and then replaced, forming a ring round the bride’s
garter, which lay in the centre of the table, or a borrowed
one doing duty for the time. As each glass had
to be lifted on the word <span class="smcap lowercase">DRINK</span>, and tapped against that
of its right and left hand neighbour at <span class="smcap lowercase">CHINK</span>, then
set on the table again without spilling, some one would
have to pay for glasses round. The verse ran:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse indent22">Drink, Drink, Drink.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Quite a collection of these catch-songs might be
made; they are all quaint, and if they point to days
when things were a trifle different, we must bear in
mind that a hundred years hence we shall be pretty
severely criticized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<h3><i>Birth.</i></h3>

<p>The future of a child greatly depends upon which
day it is born.</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">A Munday’s bairn will grow up fair,</div>
  <div class="verse">A Tuesday’s yan i’ grace thruff prayer,</div>
  <div class="verse">A Wednesday’s bairn ’ez monny a paain,</div>
  <div class="verse">A Tho’sday’s bairn weean’t bahd at heeam.</div>
  <div class="verse">A Friday’s bairn is good an’ sweet,</div>
  <div class="verse">A Settherday’s warks frea morn ti neet,</div>
  <div class="verse">Bud a Sunday’s bairn thruff leyfe is blist</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ seear i’ t’ end wi’ t’ Saints ti rist.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>From the day of its birth to that of its baptism,
pepper cake, cheese and wine, or some other cordial,
are offered to all those who cross the threshold. No
one would think of refusing to ’tak a bite an’ sup,’ to
wish the little stranger all the happiness and good
luck possible. In many places, the doctor cuts the
cake and cheese immediately after the happy event is
over, giving a piece to every one present; neither
cake nor cheese must have been previously cut into,
and what is cut must be divided into just so many
pieces as there are friends present, neither more
nor less. Should it unfortunately happen the pieces
exceed in number that of the guests, it would portend
that troubles in this life will be too many to contend
against; but should there be not enough pieces to go
all round, then the child in after years will lack many
of those comforts, the possession of which make life
a blessing.</p>

<p>When possible, a new arrival, before being laid by
its mother’s side, or even touched by her, is placed in
the arms of a maiden. To a boy, this early contact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
with our highest ideal of earthly purity, gives to him
a nobleness of character which in after years will help
the world to be better, whilst in the case of a girl she
will grow up to be modest and pure in all things. The
idea is pretty.</p>

<p>In Cleveland, and some of the dales westward, the
notion still prevails that a child should always go up
in the world before it goes down; so when it happens
that a child is born in the topmost story, in which case
it is impossible to carry it into a higher room, the
nurse will stand upon the bed with the child in her arms,
holding it above the mother, that being a higher
position than it held at its birth. After this ceremony
it may be safely taken to the lower regions. Were
this rite omitted, and the child allowed to descend
before it had gone up, failure in life would most likely
be the lot of such a one—the tendency of such always
being downhill. These little ceremonies, anyway,
point a splendid moral. One cannot begin to be
good and diligent too early in life.</p>

<p>When a child is born with a mask or caul over its
head, good luck will follow it all the days of its life,
always provided the caul is properly preserved.
There is some rite in the preservation of such, the
details of which I have not been able to obtain.
Speaking to one old dame, she said to me that she
did not rightly know what they did in such cases,
none of her children having been fortunate enough to
be so distinguished at their birth. This much, however,
she did know, that some just dried such a covering
by laying it between two layers of muslin, but—and
to give her own words—‘Ther’s other some ’at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
’ev a straange carrying on wi’ sike leyke; they lap it
roond t’ Bahble an’ deea summat, bud Ah deean’t
knaw what, bud Ah can git ti knaw foor ya.’ That
cannot be now; she has crossed the borderland. That
such cauls or masks were held in high esteem at one
time, is proved by the high prices paid for them,
not because they had belonged to people of note or
high degree, but because they possessed the power
to ward off many evils which might assail the
possessor. Sailors even to-day set great store by
them: they act as a charm, saving the possessor
from drowning in case of a wreck. These veils were
much prized by witches, and great was the evil
they could work should such ever come into their
possession, hence the necessity of using all precautions
against their loss.</p>

<p>An old body, Ann Caygill by name—I think she
was a native of Bedale—told me the following story.
She was seventy-five years of age, and the event took
place some twenty years before she was born, but as
the individual affected told the story to Ann herself,
I have it pretty much from its original source. Jane
Herd at her birth had a mask covering both head and
face, which, as quite natural in those days, her mother
carefully preserved. It turned out to be one of
extraordinary power. If Jane laid it on the Bible and
wished to see any one, they were bound to put in an
appearance. And many other wonders she could
work with her caul. Jane, it seems, was a pious girl,
and never used it for an evil purpose, though, said
my informant, she might have done had she been so
minded. One day when Jane was using her mask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
for some rightful purpose, a puff of wind blew it
through the open window. Jane of course rushed
into the street to recover her treasure, but it was
gone, and could not be found; being of such an
exceedingly light nature, the wind had carried it no
one knew whither.</p>

<p>And from that day Jane’s life became a burden. Her
lover grew cold—the wedding day had been arranged,
but he declined to carry out his promise—a nasty
lump came on her neck, and a fearful pain and swelling
attacked her right knee, which made her walk very
lame, and indeed she became a perfect wreck. At
last things got into such a parlous state with her, that
people began to suspect some evil-minded person had
found her mask, and was working her evil with it. It
was then remembered, when Jane had rushed into
the street to recover her lost treasure, that the only
person visible at the time was one Molly Cass<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>,
a witch of considerable local repute in those days. But
Molly at the time had been so far distant from Jane’s
cottage, that she was not even questioned. In the
end, Jane had resort to the wise man, or rather men,
of that day—Master Sadler and Thomas Spence<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>,
both of Bedale. These two worthies, after many
questions, made a sign round the lump as well as
round her knee, telling Jane to collect certain things—what
these were could not be called to mind—and
bring them next day near midnight. These several
things having been collected and duly delivered to the
charmers, were mixed together, with other ingredients,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
and the whole boiled on a wickenwood fire, and
stirred by Jane with a wickenwood stick; near the
end of this boiling, a great smoke arose from the pan,
which Jane was told to inhale. She did so, but it
nearly choked her, still she kept on swallowing
mouthful after mouthful, until she had done so nine
times; she was then told to cease stirring, but to retain
the stick in one hand, the other being laid on the
Bible. She had then to repeat the following question:
‘Has—— ’ (here mentioning the name of anyone she
suspected) ‘gotten mah caul?’ Then Master Sadler,
after a moment’s pause, said, ‘No, she is free.’ Master
Spence then joined in with ‘By the power of the Holy
Writ and the charm of Hagothet and Arcon<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>, mention
the name of some other person thou doubtest.’ This
formula was gone through until the name of Molly
Cass was mentioned. Even as the witch’s name was
uttered, the pan boiled over, filling the room with such
a fearful stench, that all three had to hurry into the
yard. So quickly was this accomplished, that they surprised
the old witch scrambling off a settle, upon
which she had been standing to enable her to peep
through a small hole in the shutters. She was instantly
seized and thrust into the room, and kept there until
so nearly suffocated, that she confessed she had the caul
on her person, and promised then and there to deliver
it up. On being brought out of the room more dead
than alive, she further confessed that she had been forced
to run all the way from Leeming—the current belief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
however, was that she had come astride of a besom—the
moment they had put the pan on the wickenwood
fire. She begged to be forgiven, but as a punishment
she was locked up in a stable, a wicken peg having been
driven into the door to prevent her from escaping; and
next day, for the diversion of the Bedale inhabitants,
she was hurried to the mill dam and duly ducked
nine times.</p>

<p>The above would, I believe, be written about the
year 1810 by one who wrote under the signature
of R. H.<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> At that time Molly must have been dead
some twenty years, but her deeds would still be
remembered by many. Mr. W. Hird, from whom
I had the above fragment, told me he used to know
the whole piece, which was of considerable length.</p>

<p>But to return to recent times, still keeping to Bedale.
I remember a shopkeeper’s wife saying to me, ‘That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
girl has been lucky, but then she had a veil on when
she was born, so one need not wonder.’</p>

<p>The case is a simple one, I know, but a straw shows
which way the wind blows, and here was the belief
still flourishing in the potency of the caul. This
happened about twenty years ago. One has no need
to go that far back; so recently as four years ago, a man,
a native of Great Ayton, said to me, pointing to a girl,
‘Ah’ve putten that lass’s muther intiv a straange stew.
Ah’ve stown’ (stolen) t’ lass’s mask, an’ her muther’s
ommaist to’n’d t’ hoos upsahd doon latin’ on ’t, bud
Ah s’all let her ’ev ’t back agaan; Ah wadn’t keep ’t
foor nowt;’ and then he added, ‘An’ Ah wadn’t
wark neeabody onny ill wi’ ‘t.’ Here again you have
the old belief showing itself as strongly as in days
past.</p>

<p>But to return to the baby. The baby’s nails must
not be cut during infancy; should they grow inconveniently
long, they may be bitten off by the mother, for
if they were cut, the child would grow up light-fingered,
i.e. a thief. When the child has celebrated its first
birthday, they may be properly cut; but here again
certain days must be avoided—Fridays and Sundays
are considered to be very unlucky. It is a common
saying—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Better t’ baan ’ed ne’er been born,</div>
  <div class="verse">‘An cut its naals on a Sunday morn.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is no virtue attached to the pieces of the
nails when cut, but the first pieces bitten off should
be carefully preserved, until there is a scrap from
every nail on both hands; these must be wrapped
together and buried under an ash-tree, and the child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
if not freed from the diseases incident to the young,
will only have them in a slight degree.</p>

<p>The old rhyme says—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Cut ’em o’ Munday, cut ’em foor health;</div>
  <div class="verse">Cut ’em o’ Tuesday, cut ’em foor wealth;</div>

  <div class="verse">Cut ’em o’ Thorsday, ya cut foor new shoes;</div>

<p>Before the baby is nine days old it is wise to decide
upon its name, and once having done this, <em>so let
it be</em>. If either parent should happen to say, ‘We
will call it So-and-so,’ do not alter after having so
declared, for if so the child will grow up a liar, and
probably have to assume several aliases before death.
But the worst of all is to decide upon a name before
the child is born, and then afterwards change to some
other. Singular to say, in Cleveland you are told that
such a proceeding ’can end i’ nowt bud harm’; but you
are not informed either precisely what form the harm
will take, or why. There is a legend lingering still in
Wensleydale, to the effect that once a soul was permitted
to view the body it would shortly tenant. The
mother happened to say whilst the soul was near,
‘When my baby is born, if a boy, we shall have him
christened——,’ mentioning the name they had decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
upon. The soul knew it would be a boy, and on
its return to spirit-land gave a full description of the
body it was going to have for its companion on earth,
mentioning at the same time the name by which it
would be known. What then was its dismay to discover,
on being carried to the font, that it was being
christened by some other name. For a time it was
sorely troubled. What must it do? What could it
do? In the end it felt there was only one way open:
it must hurry back to soul-land and clear itself from
an apparent untruth, but in order to do this it must
free itself from the body; but if ever the soul and
body part company they never meet again. So the
baby died, and the soul went back to spirit-land.</p>

<p>The above was given to me years ago by an old
Yorkshire dame, who during her girlhood, if not a
native, lived for many years in the village of West
Burton. In the dales of Cleveland and Wensleydale,
to guard her babe from the influence of evil spirits and
bad wishes, the mother used to place a Bible under the
pillow of the sleeping child, until such time as the
infant had been christened, that being considered
sufficient protection against all evil spirits. And in
the days of witchcraft, in many houses where the first
cradle would shortly be tenanted, it was most carefully
kept wrong side up until the child was laid in it.
This was done so that no other living thing in that
house should sleep in it before the coming owner.
Otherwise the cradle would be forestalled, and in
after years the occupant might have reason to doubt
the fidelity of his wife, or vice versa.</p>

<p>In such fear was this forestalling of the cradle held,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
that one was rarely purchased until absolutely
needed. A cradle should always be paid for before
it crosses the threshold. It is said that the child
who sleeps in an unpaid-for cradle will end its days
lacking the means to pay for its own coffin, or, as
others put it, be too poor to pay for its lodgings on
the earth or in it. Should the baby when grown
older say ‘Papa’ before he or she utters ‘Mamma,’
then be assured the next little stranger will be a
boy; however, should it say ‘Mamma’ first, then
it will be a girl; and should it say ‘Papa’ and a girl
is born, then be quite sure that it said ‘Mamma’ some
little time before, when no one was near. This last
bit is mine; I like to help even a superstition out
of a difficulty.</p>

<p>If baby’s first tooth appears in the upper jaw, it
is not considered a good sign; there is a fear of the
child dying in infancy. Sometimes they don’t.</p>

<p>Should the baby be born with a mole on its chin,
success is strongly foreshadowed; the same on the left
thigh is considered quite the reverse. One on the
right temple gives wealth and high position, and one
placed at the outside corner of either eye denotes
a sudden death. Whilst</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">A dimple on the chin brings a fortune in,</div>
  <div class="verse">A dimple on the cheek leaves the fortune for to seek.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>No woman ever dreamt of crossing any threshold
but her own until after she had been churched, as in
doing so she carried ill-luck into every house she
entered.</p>

<p>At the baptism, should a boy and a girl be presented
at the same time, the boy must always be christened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
first, as otherwise he will play second fiddle to his
wife, and when come to man’s estate be for ever beardless
and effeminate; and worse than this, the baby
girl when grown up will assuredly possess more hair
on her face than is usually considered needful, and
more than beauty demands. She will also be manly
and masculine in her ways and habits.</p>

<p>When the new baby is taken round for inspection, the
lady of the house, after passing various eulogiums on
and over the small being, pins to its garments a small
packet to help the future Lord Chancellor on his way
through life. This packet contains three things—an
egg, a silver coin, and a pinch of salt: the salt, so that it
may never lack the savour of life, whatever that may
be; the egg assures it food, raiment, and a roof over
its head; and the coin starts it off with a banking
account. If these well-wishers were to add a fourth
gift, in the form of a small cane, sufficiently hypnotized
so that the young mother would be compelled to use
it when needed, what a lot of really fine bairns there
would be. Unfortunately superstition has never been
run on practical lines.</p>


<h3><i>Death.</i></h3>

<p>A lack of the needful may compel the parties
concerned to wed without the smallest attempt at
rural ostentation, but not so in the case of a funeral.
Every sacrifice is made to honour the dead. They
like it to be said that their loved ones were decently
buried. They themselves feel proud to say, ‘Aye,
he’s geean; wa’ve gitten him sahded by’ (buried),
‘an’ it war a beautiful funeral; Ah will say that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>In these days one can scarcely conceive the needless
waste of money, and by those too who can ill afford
it, which is so lavishly squandered on funeral folly.
It was even worse a few years ago.</p>

<p>Had it been possible for the moment to put on
one side the solemn fact that some dearly loved one
was being borne to his or her last long rest, funerals,
as I remember them years ago in Ripon, were more
like circus processions than anything else. Happily
many of the old notions are being laid aside by the
rising generation. Yet often to-day in country places,
as far as circumstances will admit, the old order of
things is most rigidly observed.</p>

<p>Two years ago I witnessed a country funeral,
almost in all the pristine glory of my youthful days.
One thing it lacked, the hearse and horses with their
sombre nodding plumes. This, be it remembered, was
the funeral of a widow’s son, her finances at the time
being in anything but a flourishing condition. Two
mutes stood guarding the open door. A silk scarf
about three yards long was given to each bearer and
mourner to fasten round his hat, and a pair of black kid
gloves to every one bidden. I cannot say how much
port wine was drunk, what it cost per bottle, or the
weight of finger biscuits consumed, but as these were
freely handed to every one assembled inside and outside
the house, who could roll a pocket handkerchief
into a ball, and assume a funereal aspect of countenance,
considerable expense must have been incurred with
these two items alone. After the return from the
graveside, there was the funeral feast. Those who have
never seen what provision is made for an affair of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
kind can form but a very poor idea of the actual
amount of food provided for and consumed by those
who follow as mourners to the graveside. Refreshment
is necessary for those who have driven, it may be, a long
distance to pay their last respect to the departed one,
but in the case of those who live near by, surely it
does not need a moment’s thought for them to decide
upon the more seemly course to pursue. The old days
of the funeral arvel, when almost the whole countryside
were bidden, not only to the funeral, but to the
funeral feast, have passed away, or nearly so. Even
to-day, in many of our dales, the neighbours are still
bidden. This bidding, and the very name of it, are both
of Scandinavian origin. The order of men carrying
men, and women women, is still observed. The same
also with the sex of the young; only, in the case of
a young maiden, the girls who act as bearers are
dressed in white, and the carrying of a garland in
front of the coffin is not even yet extinct. At one
time these garlands<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> were after the funeral hung up
in the church, and I believe in some of our dale
churches in Cleveland these emblems of purity are to
be seen hanging yet.</p>

<p>In the case of women who died in childbirth,
a white sheet was thrown over the coffin. The bearing
of the coffin either by towels (staves are things of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the past now) or on the shoulders is equally common
in various parts of the riding.</p>

<p>Should the family of the departed one possess
a hive, the announcement of a death must at once be
made to the bees, and the hive be draped in black.
The bees must also have given to them a portion of
everything, to the minutest detail, which is offered to
the bidden guests, including wine, spirits, tobacco, and
pipes; nothing must be omitted, for in some undefined
way bees watch over the welfare of those to
whom they belong, and it would be unwise to offend
them. It is held that if the first swarm following
a death, no matter how long the interval, is easy to
hive, success is guaranteed for the next business
transaction, but should the swarm settle on a dead
bough, it foretells death to another of the family in
the near future; while should the swarm fly away
and be lost, then great care must be exercised in all
undertakings, until such times as a swarm has been
successfully hived.</p>

<p>It is not so very long ago since every funeral at
Guisborough<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> was headed by the sexton singing a
hymn from the house to the church gates, but this
singing by friends is common to-day.</p>

<p>The superstitions connected with the dying and
the dead are many and varied. Few country people
doubt the existence of a power by which the living
can (as they put it) hold back the dying. It is not
an uncommon thing to hear some one say, ‘Sha
wad ’a’e deed last neet, nobbut Mary wadn’t let her
gan,’ or ‘Mary wadn’t gi’e her up,’ or ‘Mary ho’ds on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
tiv her seea.’ It is, as it were, the last link of the
chain connecting life with the earthly side of eternity,
the snapping of which would for ever free the soul,
but which the dying person is unable to break, because
some one refuses to be reconciled; they cannot
bear to part with them, and in this way hold them
back. Again, the soul cannot free itself if the dying
person has been laid on a bed containing pigeon
feathers, or the feathers of wild birds even. Instances
are on record of pigeon feathers having been placed
in a small bag, and thrust under dying persons to
hold them back, until the arrival of some loved one;
but the meeting having taken place, the feathers
were withdrawn, and death allowed to enter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when something unaccountable
has seemed to prevent a person <i lang="la">in extremis</i> from
passing into the other world, pigeon feathers have
often been suspected. Under such circumstances the
invalid has been lifted out of bed, and either laid
upon another one, or seated in a chair. And as a rule
death speedily followed either treatment, the patient
passing away in an incredibly short space of time,
which of course clearly proved that such feathers had
inadvertently been mixed with those in the bed.</p>

<p>When the signs of death are observed the windows
and door are thrown wide open, and a silence as still
as death itself is maintained, so that nothing shall
either hinder the dark angel from setting his seal on
their loved one, or impede the soul’s flight over the
borderland into that of the great unknown.</p>

<p>Much of what is done may be rooted in the rankest
superstition, or in many cases long-forgotten pagan rites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
and one feels inclined to smile; but, after a moment’s
consideration, one is forcibly reminded that it is equally
deeply rooted in the old belief, which embraces in its
faith a devil, a fiery hell, Jonah, whale, and everything.
As things go nowadays, theorists are not leaving us
much to believe or be superstitious about.</p>

<p>The death-watch, with its ’tick-a-tick,’ has blanched
the cheek of many an otherwise brave Yorkshire man
and woman. Tell them it is only the head of a small
beetle called <i>Atropos</i> tapping against the wood as it
eats its way out, and they will jeer at you. They
know, as their fore-elders did before them, that it is
the sign of death; if not for some one in that house,
assuredly so for some one in the village, and by-and-by
some one dies, and wise heads are shaken—they
knew.</p>

<p>Every care is taken that nothing animate shall pass
over the corpse. I never heard of any domestic pet
having been killed which so offended, though such at
one time would have been the case a little further north.</p>

<p>The belief still lingers that the passing bell possesses
the power to drive away all evil spirits, and so prevent
them from troubling the soul in its upward flight, for
even to-day a sexton, on being asked to ‘ put the bell
in,’ is also often urged to do so as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>It is looked upon as a kindly action, when standing
by the corpse of some dear one, if the visitor gently
touch the same. In some undefined way, this solemn
contact of the living with the dead, makes known to
the sorrowing ones that nothing but sympathy is felt.
By this act all past injuries or misunderstandings, if
such existed, are blotted out, forgiven, forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>So soon as the vital spark has left its earthly house,
the fire, if such be burning in the room, is immediately
extinguished<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>, and it is not an uncommon thing for
the looking-glass to be either draped entirely, turned
with its face to the wall, or removed from the room.
The omens denoting the near approach of death are
many—a white dove fluttering near the window, the
rapid flight of birds over the house, and in some
instances the actual appearance, to some dearly loved
one, of the wraith of the person about to die. Many
instances of the latter could be given.</p>

<p>I cannot say when or where the Lyke Wake
dirge was sung for the last time in the North
Riding, but I remember once talking to an old chap
who remembered it being sung over the corpse of a
distant relation of his, a native of Kildale. This would
be about 1800, and he told me that Lyke Wakes
were of rare occurrence then, and only heard of in
out-of-the-way places. Doubtless this was so, but
a superstition closely connected with the Lyke Wake
is still with us. Old people will tell you that after
death the soul passes over Whinny Moor, a place full
of whins and brambles; and according as the soul
when a tenant of the body administered to the wants
of others, so would its passage over the dreaded moor
be made easy. It seems, according to the old belief,
every one ought to give at least one pair of new shoes
to some poor person, and as often as means would
allow, feed and clothe the needy. Whether these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
rules were faithfully carried out or not, the soul on
approaching Whinny Moor would be met by an old
man carrying a huge bundle of boots; and if amongst
these could be found a pair which the bare-footed soul
had given away during life, the old man gave them
to the soul to protect its feet whilst crossing the
thorny moor.</p>

<p>Although there is a place called Whinny Moor, as
used in the Lyke Wake song it is mythical, simply representing
a wearying hindersome tract of land through
which the soul must perforce pass, the ease or difficulty
of such passage being lesser or greater according
to the good deeds done and alms bestowed during
life. There are other versions of the song; the one
here given is as it was dictated to me. How the
original from which it was taken was worded, I
cannot say. There is another version in the North
Riding which seems to have been written according to
the tenets of Rome; at least I imagine so, as purgatory
takes the place of hellish flames, as given above. It
may be mentioned that the influence of the Reformation
never reached many of the dales in Cleveland
and those further westward. Hence the more com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>monly
known version is in the phraseology of the
predominant belief of that time.</p>

<p>Evidently the version given is one of a much later
date, and must have been sung by a Protestant.</p>

<p>As to the ‘Brigg o’ Dreead,’ I dare say but little;
‘Fools only rush gaily in where angels fear to tread.’
However, I may venture this far; just as Whinny Moor
had to be passed, so the ‘Brigg o’ Dreead’ had to be
crossed. Upon one point all authorities agree. Wherever
it was, or whatever its form, the Brigg was the real
crux. Whether we incline to the theory that it was as
narrow as a thread, shaky as an aspen leaf, or slippery
as a glacier side, it had to be crossed. This accomplished,
the soul was fairly safe. But did it slip or
stumble whilst crossing, then the length of time
occupied in its fearful descent, the depth to which it
fell, together with all the concomitant evils belonging
thereto, depended solely upon the amount of good
and evil with which it had been accredited during its
earthly pilgrimage.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>OMENS, CHARMS, RECIPES</small></h2>


<p>Quite a volume might be written on the above;
their number and variety is legion. Therefore in
brief only will it be possible to treat many of our
omens, &amp;c. To some few of the more striking a few
details will be given.</p>

<p>Many of the omens, charms, &amp;c., quoted are in no
sense peculiar either to our riding or county. They
are with us, they are duly observed, and the belief
in them is not wholly dead yet.</p>

<p>To break a looking-glass foreshadows an early
death, or great evil in the near future, and for any
one (if they have not previously seen or spoken to the
person that day) to look over his or her shoulder, so
that their reflection is seen in the glass, foretells an
untimely death to one or both. Should a hen crow,
the reward for its exhibiting such marvellous vocal
powers would be immediate death. The old song
says (date, the early seventies)—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Than awn a crawing hen,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ah seeaner wad t’ au’d divil meet,</div>
  <div class="verse indent6">Hickity O, pickity O, pompolorum jig,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
  <div class="verse">Or breed a whistling lass,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ah seeaner wad t’ au’d divil treeat,</div>
  <div class="verse indent6">Hickity O, pickity O, pompolorum jig.</div>
  <div class="verse">Nowt bud ill-luck ’ll fester wheear</div>
  <div class="verse">Ther craws an’ whistles sike a pair;</div>
  <div class="verse">Maay hens an’ wimin breed neea mair,</div>
  <div class="verse indent6">Pompolorum jig.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A dog howling under your window three nights
in succession portends evil or death in the near future.
A picture falling, if the glass be broken, speaks clearly
of a death in the family at no very distant date; the
glass being intact, implies that misfortune of some
kind is hanging overhead, but possibly everything
may come right in the end.</p>

<p>A strange cat coming to your house, if black, should
never be driven away; if you do so, you simply drive
luck from your door.</p>

<p>If you are unmarried, be very careful to keep in
mind the fact that, having attended three funerals,
you must at least be present during part of a wedding
service before standing at the graveside of a fourth,
or you will die single, unless you are exceedingly
rash, and get married in spite of everything.</p>

<p>If you accidentally break anything, it is a good plan
to let two other articles of little or no value slip from
your hand. This will save you from breaking two
other things of value, because you are bound to smash
three, and it is really an advantage to be allowed to
choose two of them yourself.</p>

<p>Yes, things go by threes. If one death takes place
in a street, it won’t be long ere the bell tolls for two
others—so say they.</p>

<p>If the youngest daughter in a family is married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
first, the eldest had better unravel one of her garters,
knitting the same, mixed with other wool, into something
a man can wear. This she must present to
the one she has a special regard for, and it most
likely will incline his heart towards her. Garters,
by-the-way, are rather out of it now; they once were
articles in great request, to work charms and spells
with, but that was in the days when either a long
band with a buckle, or a knitted affair about an inch
wide and a yard long, was universally worn. In these
days of patent things and other inventions, some
of which do not encircle the leg at all, the girls
are debarred from resorting to many of the old-time
spells. In days past, so long as a fellow wore
one of his lady love’s garters round his neck, he
was bound to be true to her and she to him. Did
a fellow try the same thing now, he would strangle
himself. The old-time garters, by-the-way, had other
uses; the Bible, a key, and a garter often playing
the part of a private detective, or infallibly making
known to some doubting maiden the name of the
man she would marry. The <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> was as
follows:—In the case of an undetected thief, a key
was placed within the Bible; this was bound securely
within by winding a garter round it, the whole being
suspended from a nail. The name of the supposed
thief was now mentioned three times—in some districts
seven—and if the key turned round, the thief
was discovered.</p>

<p>Very similar were the rites used for the discovery of
a future husband. In this case, however, the maiden
wishing to know her fate, had to use one of her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
garters, and it was also needful that the Bible should
be opened at Ruth i. 16, 17. Some part of the key
resting on the verses named, the Bible was then closed,
and the key as before bound fast with the garter. The
questioner and some other person now seated themselves
opposite each other, each placing an elbow on
a table and resting the open part of the key on their
index fingers. All being thus arranged, the names of
several of their male acquaintances were mentioned,
the key turning on the name of the future husband
being uttered. Not long ago the writer helped a
maiden through the ceremony. The above, and the
two following, are still commonly resorted to.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in obtaining information
touching the time you will be married. Simply let
an anxious maiden take a looking-glass, and an apron
which she has never worn or held between herself
and the light, into the garden when the moon is at
full; she must be careful not to look upon the queen
of night until the rites are concluded. Keeping her
back, then, to the moon, let her stand upon something
she has never stood upon before—a newspaper, an old
box, anything—and drawing the apron over the glass,
hold it so that the moon shines upon it; let her now
count the number of moons she sees reflected through
the apron, and so many years will it be before the
happy day arrives. I may mention, if such a one is in
any violent hurry to get married, it is best to choose
the apron of some light material, and to draw it
tightly over the glass; careful attention to these small
details has a marvellous tendency to lessen the
number of moons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>Throughout Cleveland the maidens have recourse
to the following method of divination for the discovery
whether they are to be married or die old maids.
From a stream running southward a maiden fills a
clean glass with water, and having borrowed an old
wedding ring, or one worn by a widow—the ring
must grace maternity—she suspends it over the glass
of water hanging by a single hair drawn from
her own head, her elbow resting on the table and
the hair being laid over the ball of the thumb.
Should the ring hit the side of the glass, her fate
is sealed—she will die an old maid; if, however,
it spins round quickly, she will have to wait a year;
if slowly, she will be wedded more than once.</p>

<p>It is commonly held that if you can find a four-leaved
clover, and then walk backward upstairs to
bed, sleeping with the leaf under your pillow, you
will dream of the man you will marry.</p>

<p>It is considered most unlucky to see the new moon
for the first time through glass. To break the spell
cast upon you by such an unfortunate occurrence,
make the sign of the cross on the doorstep, and jump
backwards over it into the house.</p>

<p>Should a hairy worm cross your path, pick it up,
throw it over your shoulder, and wish.</p>

<p>If you tread on an ordinary road beetle, rain will
presently fall.</p>

<p>Whenever you hear a cuckoo, turn the money over
in your pocket for luck.</p>

<p>To see a single magpie is very unlucky; two
together is the reverse.</p>

<p>To see a single owl is also unlucky; but to hear one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
hoot, and then see it, foretells that you will have
timely warning of some impending evil.</p>

<p>Wet your finger and cross your left shoe and wish
every time you see a piebald horse.</p>

<p>Should two persons utter the same words at the
same time, they must link their little fingers together
and wish, keeping their wish secret.</p>

<p>The deciduous teeth of a male child, which have
not touched the ground, if kept about the person are
a specific against all manner of evil.</p>

<p>To ensure the child having a good and sound set
of teeth, those which fall out of themselves, or which
the child itself pulls out, should be dipped in salt and
thrown into the fire.</p>

<p>A tooth found in a churchyard is believed to charm
away the toothache if rubbed on the cheek.</p>

<p>And lastly, children’s teeth must either be carefully
preserved or utterly destroyed by fire with salt, as
should one accidentally be swept away and fall into
the ground, or be buried by some evil-minded person,
the child will not live long, the first rites of ashes
to ashes having been consummated.</p>

<p>No luck will follow a declaration of love if made on
St. Dunstan’s Day.</p>

<p>To be wed on St. Thomas’s Day makes a bride a
widow ere long.</p>

<p>A young woman, a native of Great Ayton, assured
me the following was a certain charm for obtaining
a sight of one’s future spouse. The individual
desirous of obtaining such a vision must make a cake
of the following ingredients:—flour, a small pinch of
graveyard mould taken from nine different graves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
sufficient water from nine distinct sources, a pinch of
salt, and a drop or two of blood from her third finger.
The resulting dough had to be baked at midnight on
the eve before that of St. Agnes, and whilst warm
placed under the pillow; if found whole in the morning,
well and good; if not, the charm could not be
carried to its conclusion until the following year.
The cake, if whole, had to be carried on the eve of
St. Agnes and laid where four cross roads meet.
All being accomplished, just before midnight the
future husband or wife would come along, halt, look
at the cake, and then vanish. Although the night
might be pitch-dark, the apparition, it seems, would
be quite visible. Immediately the spirit form vanished,
the watcher must regain possession of the cake at
once, or the water elves would seize it and work all
manner of evil. These water elves keep cropping up,
but little of their doings and nothing of their appearance
seems to be known amongst our people. It is
a bit of lost myth.</p>

<p>During harvest time you may easily discover how
long you are destined to wait before being led to the
altar. When the moon is at full, pluck three ripe
ears of barley, which must be carefully wrapped up
together with something belonging to him you love
best. The parcel must be laid under your pillow,
and on arising in the morning, open it, and if all the
grains have remained <i lang="la">in situ</i>, then you will be wed
that year; but if any have broken away, count how
many—they tell how many years you will remain
single.</p>

<p>If a young fellow is in love, and the girl’s heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
does not incline towards him, there is a charm which
will cast a spell about her from which she cannot escape.
There is a difficulty, and rather a grave one, but love
surmounts all things, so they say. He must cut off
a willow knot and chew it. So far, it is quite a simple
affair; given time, a love-lorn swain might manage
to masticate the whole tree. But now comes the
difficulty—having chewed the said knot, he must
secrete the same in the bed of the girl he loves. Once
she falls asleep with that chewed knot as her companion,
she will be bound to yield to his importunities.
Should, however, the knot be so placed that it causes
the fair sleeper such inconvenience that she is compelled
to find the cause, and having done so, throws
it away, that young man may consider his case as
hopeless.</p>

<p>If you can, within three days after becoming engaged,
seize a snail by its horns and throw it over
your left shoulder, you will to a very considerable
extent reduce the roughness of the road which true
love is said to journey along.</p>

<p>And remember it is unlucky to say good-night
three times to the girl you love, without returning
to the house and starting the whole thing over
again, but one doesn’t mind that. When parting
with friends for any length of time, never say goodbye
without adding that you hope to see them again,
and never watch the parting ones out of sight—it is
most unlucky.</p>

<p>The various nostrums administered, and the methods
employed in days past for the cure of all the diseases
man is heir to, one cannot help but think, if carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
observed, would usually have terminated in a funeral
feast. The rank filth our forefathers had prepared
for them, and doubtless were induced to swallow, has
left behind the unsolvable mystery of accounting
for the fact that specimens of the Anglo-Saxon race
are still extant. Putting on one side for the moment
the wretched stuff they had to swallow, let us turn to
a few things usually employed to effect a cure.</p>

<p>If any one was seized with a colic, and colic water
was not handy, all that was necessary was for some
one to slip out and catch either a carp or a pike, slit
the fish open whilst alive, and clap it on the stomach
of the sufferer—and lo! a cure. This sounds all very
nice, but it has often taken me three days to catch
a pike, and carp, by-the-way, are not very widely
distributed; and as colic water required for the making
thereof nearly every flower which blooms in our
woods and gardens, and of two or three others which
never do so in ’perfidious Albion’—and when actually
all things had been obtained, it could not be properly
prepared under nine months—possibly there may
have been some other remedy I have not heard of, and
which could be applied during the time the pike was
being captured, otherwise the patient would often
have a lengthy squirm of it.</p>

<p>For pains in the joints, a toad tied belly downwards
over the affected part would enable the patient to
walk as well as ever. Now this is something sensible;
just you find a poor body suffering from pains in the
joints, and then produce a toad, and you will work
a miracle. Long before you can tie it belly downwards
anywhere, the patient, if a female, will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
beating her best running record; if a male, his joints
will be right in an instant, and you will have to take
the toad outside, minus dignity.</p>

<p>An old lady tells me she has known a drink made
from the following ingredients do a power of good in
case of fever:—a handful of dandelion, agrimony, verjuice,
rue, powdered crab’s eyes and claws, and yarrow
from off a grave. These had to be boiled for some
hours, and taken when the moon was on the wane.
Doubtless there was another recipe equally efficacious
for those who unfortunately were struck down with
fever when the moon was on the rise.</p>

<p>The tongue of a still-born calf, if dried and worn so
that it touched the spine, would prevent fits of almost
any kind.</p>

<p>Wart-charmers are not defunct yet. I know several
who, after pronouncing an inaudible incantation, rub
the wart with a special stone, and then you are assured
the wart or warts will die. Frog spit rubbed on
a wart is said to be a certain cure. If you rub your
wart with a black snail, sticking the snail on a thorn
where you will never see it again, the wart, as the
snail dies, will disappear. If you yearn to afflict
any one with warts, let them wash in water in which
eggs have been boiled. This belief is quite common
to-day. A plate of salt, upon which a dead man’s
hand has rested overnight, used to be considered good
for chilblains.</p>

<p>Master Sadler of Bedale, in the year 1773, undertook
the cure of ague in quite a simple way. After the
patient had answered a few searching questions
touching his past private life—which information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
doubtless he would much rather have kept to himself—his
name was chalked at the back of the hob, an
incantation pronounced, and he went home whole.
I am inclined to the belief that many in these
days would have to take the ague back with them.
The ague is bad enough, but for a fellow to systematically
trot out one’s past doings would be infinitely
worse. That was a hundred years ago; but only the
other day I was told that if a field-mouse was skinned
and made into a small pie and eaten, and the warm
skin bound hair-side against the throat, and kept
there for nine days, the worst whooping cough ’’at
ivver was’ would be cured.</p>

<p>Speaking of whooping cough, I remember a lady at
Guisborough, only a few years ago, taking both her
boys to the gasworks for them to inhale the fumes
from the gas-tank. It nearly poisoned the whole three,
but the cough survived it nicely. However, that and
the field-mouse were infinitely preferable to the recipe
I had from an old dame, who assured me ’no cough o’
no kind whatsoever could stan’ agaan it.’ It was this:
equal quantities of hare’s dung and owl’s pellets—the
latter are the disgorged remains of feathers, bones, &amp;c.,
which the owl objects to digest. Well, having carefully
mixed these two ingredients with dill-water, clay, and
the blood of a white duck, the resulting filth had to
be made into pills the size of a nut, three of which
had to be taken fasting on going to bed. This was
to be continued until the cough was cured or the
patient buried. A much simpler method is to catch
a frog, open its mouth and cough into it three times,
throw the poor brute over your left shoulder, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
patient will be cured at once. If not, depend upon it
there is some very good reason why the charm has
failed. One woman I knew, used to take her little
girl and hold her over an old well when a bad fit of
coughing seized the child. She declared, if at the time
either a frog or a toad happened to be at the bottom
of the well with its mouth open, the child would be
cured instantly. I offered to catch her a frog and
open its mouth for the child to cough into; this she
objected to, because, as she said, the frog might spit
at it and injure it for life. This belief in the poisonous
and spitting power of frogs is still retained by
the good people of Great Ayton, and also of many
other places. I remember an old angler once saying
to me, ‘Ya see, the Lord gav’ t’ fishes understan’ing;
tha knaw ’at frogs is venomous, an’ tha’re a gran’
bait foor pike, bud neea pike’ll tak ho’d if ya deean’t
run t’ heuk thruff baith ther lips, seea ez tha can’t spit
at ’em.’ ‘But,’ said I, ‘how do the pike catch them when
they are swimming in a natural state?’ ‘Easy eneeaf,’
answered he; ‘tha tak hodden ’em fra behint, an’ tha
can’t spit backkards waay ower ther heeads, ya knaw.’</p>

<p>Still another plan may be tried to ease the little
sufferers. If they be passed nine times under the belly
and over the back of either a piebald pony or an ass
(the latter preferred), the cough will be immediately
charmed away, whilst a touch on the larynx from
the hand of a seventh son of a seventh son is held
to be a certain cure. And a hairy caterpillar or small
wood-lizard tied round the child’s neck, having been
stitched in a small bag, was, and I believe is yet,
looked upon as a sovereign remedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>Snail soup is drunk even to-day for the cure of
consumption. And the skin of an eel (if skinned
when alive), placed in a silken bag and worn so as to
rest on the chest, is believed to cut phlegm when
nothing else will.</p>

<p>To cure the ‘water-springs,’ an old name for acidity
or heartburn, old people tell me the following is an
infallible cure if taken in time—a very wise proviso—burnt
oyster, cockle, and mussel shells ground to
powder, equal parts, and mixed in worm-water. This
latter was prepared by gathering a handful of worms
from the churchyard and boiling them. The burnt
shells might do good; ordinary water and chalk
would have been equally efficacious, had they but
known it.</p>

<p>But nearly every disease or complaint had its cure
in days past, and, in a more or less degree, all were
nasty.</p>

<p>For the moment let us return to wart-charmers.
There is room here for both speculation and research.
They did cure warts, of that there is not the least
shadow of a doubt. The amount of evidence on
record is such that contradiction and disbelief amounts
to crass folly, and shows an ignorance of well-authenticated
facts. A man I know, whose hand was covered
with warts—warts which simply jeered at caustic and
all such applications—at last went to the charmer.
What did the man do? He simply asked the
old chap if he believed he could remove them.
Having answered in the affirmative, the charmer just
rubbed his hand over the whole lot, muttered some
words, and told the warty one to go home—in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
fortnight’s time he was wartless. Hundreds of cases
could be given. Absolute faith that they would disappear,
may have exercised some mental action over
the physical, and the trick was done. In this way,
if we admit some hypnotic power which they unconsciously
used, we may account for many of the wonders
which these charmers and wise men worked in days
past, often bringing about results at which possibly
no one was more surprised than the wise men themselves;
but they, like many of to-day, had the sense
to hold their peace, and that has often dressed many
a conjuring trick with all trappings of philosophy.</p>

<p>It is held to-day, when any one is bitten by a dog,
that the only certain remedy against hydrophobia
is to have the brute killed at once. For, say they,
should the dog in years to come go mad, all those
bitten by it will go mad at the same time.</p>

<p>The wearing of silver rings made from a single
coin presented at Holy Communion, was once held as
a sovereign remedy and preventive against epileptic
fits.</p>

<p>The cures for children and others afflicted with
worms are many and curious. A few of the more
striking will be noticed. A bunch of fine yarrow,
gathered from off a maiden’s grave, had to be boiled
in water, and a wineglassful of the liquor, with
the addition of as much finely powdered glass as
would lie on a groat, had to be taken fasting for
six alternate mornings, bearing in mind that each
morning the patient was not fattening himself on
corpse yarrow and broken window-panes; he had also
to swallow a stiff glass of salts and senna, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
not only made every kind of worm quit its hold of
his inside, but left him in a condition almost, if
not quite, ready for the worms to commence their
attack from the outside. Worms, however, are seized
with such a sudden fear when a live trout is brought
near them, that they die right off. Hence it is not
an uncommon thing for a father to procure a live
trout, and lay the same on the stomach of a wormy
one. And then, what with the fish kicking and the
bairn screaming, the poor worms have no chance, and
they know it, and throw up the sponge accordingly.</p>

<p>In days past cramp seems to have awakened people
three or four times a week. But sleeping with your
stockings on, with a piece of sulphur in each, or the
skin of a mole bound round the left thigh, or even
crossing your shoes on retiring to rest, would drive
the cramp away. Cramp, it would seem, was formerly
looked upon as having a very close connexion with
the devil, and was often the result of an evil wish,
spell, or witch-work. In cases when it arose from
any of the latter, something more potent than
sulphur and the crossing of shoes had to be resorted
to. A silken thread which had been passed round
a coffin, care having been taken to thread the silk
through the handles, would, if worn round the leg,
just below the knee-joint, securely guard the wearer
against wicked spells of that nature.</p>

<p>The skin of an eel, if tied round the leg, prevents
cramp whilst bathing.</p>

<p>Rings fashioned from any metal accidentally turned
up whilst digging a grave, were until quite recently
in great repute, especial virtue being attached to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
one made from a coffin handle. Such rings acted as
a charm against almost every kind of evil spell.</p>

<p>Years ago it was commonly believed that there
was some kind of sympathy existing between the
cause and the injury itself. An illustration of this
has been given in the case of a dog-bite, but it had
a much wider application; e.g. should any one be
injured by a nail, or anything else, the nail, &amp;c.,
was carefully cleaned, polished, wrapped up, and put
away each time after dressing the wound.</p>

<p>I remember a case in point within the last ten
years. A plough lad was hurt by the colter, the
cutting iron of the plough; the ploughing was
stopped, the colter removed, and sent to the blacksmith,
with orders to remove all dirt and rust, and
to polish all parts to which blood was adhering; and
during the recovery, each time the wound was dressed,
the colter was cleaned and polished with equal care.</p>

<p>Flint arrow-heads were for ages looked upon as
elf-stones, and are to-day worn as charms against
unseen evils. They also possess healing power in
certain diseases. So, too, do the belemnites—a
fossilized portion of an extinct cuttle-fish. These,
in the hand of a skilled person, work wonders in
the case of sore eyes and ringworm. Unfortunately,
though belemnites are common enough, the skilled
hands are rare, and so their virtue in thousands of
instances lies dormant. These belemnites are supposed
to fall from the clouds during a thunderstorm;
the same is said of rounded pieces of quartz or flints,
one and all being called thunder-bolts, or ’thunner-steeans.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>When a boy, I was an ardent archaeologist. I remember
on one occasion having been told that chipped
flints were to be found in a field near Blois Hall<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>.
Hurrying thither the first whole holiday, I was fortunate
enough on that occasion to find a flint arrow-head—the
only one I ever did find. This I showed to an
old fellow who was hedging; without hesitation he
pronounced it to be an elf-stone, declaring that the
elves were evil spirits, who in days past used to throw
them at the kie—I had up to that time always been
told they were shot at cattle—but my informant
stuck to throwing. I well remember that he also
said the elves got them out of whirlpools, where
they were originally made by the water spirits, but
he could not say what the water spirits used them
for, though he knew of several instances in which
both cattle and horses had been injured by the elves
throwing their elf-stones at them. He further informed
me that when the elves got them from the whirlpools,
they had much longer shanks than was on the one
I had found: this was so that better aim might be
taken with them. ‘But,’ said he, ‘tha’re nivver fund
wi’ lang shanks on, acoz t’ fairies awlus brak ’em
off, seea ez t’ elves wadn’t be yabble ti potch ’em at
t’ beasts neea mair;’ and he had been told that fairies
often wore them as ornaments. Sore eyes could be
cured by the touch from an elf-stone, if a fairy had
ever worn it, and they were also a potent love-charm
if worn so that they rested near the heart.</p>

<p>Speaking of fairies, I know an old lady who still
fully believes in their existence. She assures me they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
have most beautiful houses at a great depth below
the surface. It seems no one ever finds them, because
the little folk possess the magical power of transporting
them to a distance in an instant, should there be the
least likelihood of their being disturbed; owing to this,
‘Nobody nivver cums across ’em when well-sinking,
mining, or owt o’ that soart.’</p>

<p>The old body told me the following story:—</p>

<p>In the days when tailors went out to work, she
remembered one who came to work for her aunt
being lost for a long time in a big field, and unable
to find his way out, and all because he had said,
‘If ever he saw a fairy he would catch her, and take
her home, and put her in a bottle and keep her there.’
So it happened, when he left the house to go home,
and just when he entered the long pasture, he dropped
his scissors, and for long he could not find them, and
when he did place his hand on them, his sleeve-board
was snatched from him. He heard it drop
quite close to him, but when he stooped to pick
it up, a pork pie which the farmer’s wife had
given him mysteriously disappeared; how, he did
not know. However, a little way off, he saw a most
beautiful damsel carrying a light; he implored her
to come to his aid, and as the damsel and the light
would not come to him, like Mahomet he went after
them. This proved a most bootless errand, for the
damsel and light led him on and on, hither and thither,
now shining quite close at hand, then disappearing,
and at last vanishing altogether, leaving the tailor
utterly lost; and for long the poor fellow wandered
about, until his cries for help were fortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
heard, ‘bud nut afoor he’d bed aboon tweea hours
on ’t.’</p>

<p>That he had been under a fairy charm, and that
she (the fairy) had been making sport of him, was
evident to all. Never again did that man say he
would bottle a fairy—at least, I imagine so. When
a sleeve-board, a pair of scissors, and a pork pie are
snatched from you, and you see a beautiful damsel
carrying a light of some kind, which she snuffs out
every time she is going to be caught, only to light
up again some yards ahead, and then finally disappear
altogether—well! even a tailor can draw his own
conclusions after a game of that kind.</p>

<p>The other day I met an old lady in the train—a
Mrs. Peary, of Sand Hill Farm, near Picton. Although
the old lady told me she was turned seventy-three,
she was as active as a woman of forty, and boasted
she could do the work of two lasses yet. I soon
discovered she possessed a fund of both witch and
other lore. Next day I paid a visit to Sand Hill, and
had a couple of hours’ chat, or rather, I asked a few
leading questions, and then made notes as quickly
as I could.</p>

<p>For many years she lived in Bilsdale, her native
place. Now, the dale in question is only a few miles
distant from the borders of Cleveland, and yet she
had never heard of many of the customs so common
to that division of the North Riding. ‘Mell suppers,’
she told me, were kept up in Bilsdale in all their
pristine glory so lately as twenty years ago—guisers,
mell doll, and everything. She did not know the
word ‘spurrings,’ meaning putting the banns in. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
common expression in her part was, and still is,
‘So-and-so ’ev tumm’l’d ower t’ bauk an’ brokken
ther legs.’ I fail to see the application.</p>

<p>Again, though it was the custom for the bridesmaids
to undress the bride, and see her comfortably
into bed, she never remembered a case of stocking
throwing, though she had heard of it, or of any
attempt to keep the bridegroom amongst the revellers
all night. Running for the bride’s garter was common
in her mother’s time, but mostly a ribbon in her own.
She had never heard of the custom of letting a child
go up before it went down, or that it was unlucky to
mention what name the child should be christened
before its birth.</p>

<p>I mention these facts because it bears out a previous
statement, that it is inadvisable to draw conclusions as
to the non-existence of customs or superstitions on
evidence of a purely local character.</p>

<p>Although much of what the old lady told me was
general throughout the riding, the following was new
to me.</p>

<p>For whooping cough I was assured that nothing was
better than to walk along a road until you found
nine frogs; these had to be carried home and made
into soup. The patient on no account must see the
frogs, or be told of what the soup was composed—a
most wise precaution—but on his or her finishing
the whole nine, soup and all, they would be found to
be quite recovered. It’s marvellous!</p>

<p>Those who suffered from a weak bladder had a
remedy at hand: they simply had to stand astride
at the head of an open grave, after the coffin had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
been lowered, but before being filled in, and then walk
backwards to the foot of the same. It seems simple
enough, but when you come to look at it, nine people
out of ten, in endeavouring to perform the feat, would
assuredly have surprised the onlookers by turning
a somersault and landing flat on their backs upon
the coffin below.</p>

<p>Again, count your warts, then unknown to any
one take a small pebble from as many different
graves, put the lot in a small bag, throw it over
your left shoulder, and the warts will all disappear in
a few days. My old friend would not commence
or conclude any business on a Friday, and to break
a clock-face was equally as unlucky as breaking a
looking-glass. Neither did she ever allow a candle
to die out; to do such a thing was, to her way of
thinking, equal to passing sentence of death on
some one of the household. The cutting of the
pepper-cake by the doctor, on the birth of each
grandchild, is still rigidly adhered to by the old lady.
Being farmers, one ceremony they still observed,
which was quite new to me. On the birth of a calf
it was always carried rear first to the stall in which
it was to lie, a little salt and water was given it to
drink, and no one ever allowed to stride over it,
as that would mean death or ill-luck to it; but
generally ’an ower-stridden cauf deed,’ said she<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>.</p>

<p>It is a bad sign, when starting on a journey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
should the first person you meet be a woman. In
such fear was this held until quite recently, that
the fishermen near Staithes would not have gone
to sea that day; neither was it a good omen for
a four-footed animal to cross their path when going
to their boat, or at any time.</p>

<p>If whilst a fisherman was baiting his nets any one
mentioned anything in connexion with a pig, or
Dakky, as it was called, the worst of luck would be
looked for, and in many cases the fisherman would
have ceased to bait his lines for a time.</p>

<p>Again, no fisherwife would dream of winding
wool by candle-light—to do such a wicked thing
would be tantamount to winding the husband
overboard.</p>

<p>Some years ago a young fisherman paid a visit
to some relations inland; during his stay he fell in
love with a maiden whom in time he took home as
his bride. She, new to their ways and beliefs, simply
laughed at their superstitions. It happened one night,
when her husband was away on a voyage, that a
fisherwife looked in for a bit of friendly gossip, and
discovered the young wife by candle-light about to
wind some wool. She implored her not to do so, telling
her of the dreadful and sure result of such wicked
folly; others, too, who had also dropped in, joined in
declaring what a fearful and certain risk she ran, but
it was all of no avail. With a laugh at such nonsense
the winder laid the wool over a chair-back, daring them
to wait and watch her wind it; but not a woman would
stay in the house—they dare not. They fled, and the
wool was wound. Three times did the ball slip from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
her hand. When the good wives heard of it, they
shook their heads—it was a bad omen, so said they.
When the husband returned hearty and well from his
voyage, the young wife laughed at them more than
ever, but they shook their heads. The ball had
slipped from her hand thrice; he might go and
return again, it was the third journey they feared.
When he was told what his wife had done, his face
blanched—if she had no fear, he had. He had been
taught the belief all his life, she only, in a way, for
five minutes. One more voyage would he make,
and then the sea should know him no more; he would
not, dare not chance a third voyage. Again he
returned safely to his wife, but, as he had said,
that was his last voyage. The two set up a little
shop, and for three or four years all went well. Then
there came a great storm. Volunteers were needed
for the lifeboat—few able-bodied men were in the
village at the time. For the moment everything was
forgotten; Jack jumped in, and off they went, the
women helping to launch the brave crew. The
wrecked ones were saved, but in getting the last
half-drowned wretch into the boat, Jack overbalanced
and fell into the foaming sea; nothing could save him,
and his body was found lying peacefully on the beach
next morning. And then they remembered. Aye,
and so should we, had we been taught the same
belief when round our mother’s knee. The neighbours
were kind—they were more than that, they
gave to the sorrowing one all their sympathy—but,
in spite of their kindness, the widow felt that they
held her guilty of her husband’s death. So the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
little shop was closed, and she went forth from
amongst them, and the village knew her no more.</p>

<p>There is a superstition in Cleveland that you must
not eat a ’cock’s egg,’ i.e. a small egg, the last one
a hen lays before sitting. When such are found, the
contents are blown from the shell and burnt—the
merest speck of the contents even adhering to the
clothes has a baneful influence. The devil is said to
superintend the laying of this last egg.</p>

<p>It is considered advisable that a new broom should
sweep something into the house before it is used in
the contrary direction, otherwise you sweep good
luck away from your threshold.</p>

<p>I am told years ago it was considered ’a ventersome
thing ti deea’ for any one to speak disparagingly of
their broom; the reason given being that no one
was ever certain as to whether or no it had been
witch-ridden. For should it have happened that
a passing witch had one night borrowed their broom
for a ride, it became witch-ridden, and was ever
afterwards jealously watched over by the witch, and
any indignity offered to her steed was sure to be
resented.</p>

<p>It is looked upon as a most unwise thing for any
one to give salt out of the house. In days past it
was supposed to give witches power over the giver.
Cases could be mentioned in which the work of the
wise man was totally frustrated by such a proceeding.</p>

<p>It is most unlucky to give any one either a knife
or any sharp instrument: such folly severs love, and
breeds suspicion in the breasts of those who hitherto
have held you in sincere regard. You may buy such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
a present by giving something in return for it, and
such payment may be of the most trivial kind—a pin,
a bit of paper, or anything.</p>

<p>When you discover your shoe-lace is loose, walk
nine paces before tying it, otherwise you will tie
ill-luck to you for that day.</p>

<p>Should a mouse run across the room, throw something
at it, or, anyway, in the direction in which it
ran. It may happen to have escaped from a witch’s
cat, and you will please either the cat or the
witch, or both, by making some kind of pretence to
stop it.</p>

<p>It is lucky, and acts as a charm, if you spit on, or
place in your mouth, the first money you receive each
day. This is common to-day, but I doubt if those
who do so know its origin.</p>

<p>Years ago witches were supposed to watch over
or, as my informant put it, ‘eye-spell’ the first money
paid, and often used to spirit it away. This they
were unable to do after it had been placed in the
mouth. It has now degenerated into what is vulgarly
called ’spitting on ’t fer luck.’ It is quite commonly
done in our markets to-day.</p>

<p>A weasel crossing your path is most unlucky: it
speaks of treachery. This evil omen may be counteracted
by the performance of a very mean trick: drop
a coin on the road where you saw the weasel cross,
and the evil which was yours by right, will cling to
those who are unlucky enough to find it. If there
is a tramp behind you, when you see a coin lying,
leave it for him; he won’t mind about the ill-luck.</p>

<p>Always pass an old shoe so as to have it on your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
right hand; and don’t move it, lest you should help
some unknown person on in the world, which would
only be done to the detriment of yourself, for just
as much as you advanced them, to that extent you
would be the loser. An old hat you may kick about
as much as you have a mind, always being careful to
see some one has not placed a big stone underneath
it—in that case it is always unlucky to kick a hat.</p>

<p>When a child was born, and it proved either
unhealthy or deformed, it was generally supposed
some evil-disposed person must have pricked its
name with pins on a pincushion. When such a
discovery was made by an expectant wife, nothing
was said to the person working the evil, but the
cushion was stolen, the pins withdrawn one by one,
and stuck into the heart of a calf. This had to be
buried in the churchyard, care being taken to bury
it sufficiently deep, so that the dogs would not
scratch it up. All this had to be done before the
child was born, and by the mother. Such a discovery
was made, and a heart stuck with pins and
buried, within the last twenty years.</p>

<p>Sores or other evil diseases caused by witchcraft
could be speedily cured if attended to when the moon
was on the wane. I do not know in what form the
application was used, but here are the ingredients as
given to me by an old fellow who, though he had never
used it, had heard ’’at nowt cud cum up tiv it.’</p>

<p>To this day there are fisher lasses who wear their

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>WITCHCRAFT</small></h2>


<p>Witch-lore runs so very much in the same groove,
that one fairly good example throws light on many
points of interest. It was either the evil eye, or the
working of some spell, injury to cattle, or surreptitiously
riding horses during the midnight hour, an
amusement which it would seem witches were very
prone to indulge in. Then followed a visit to the
wise man, during which he did something, usually
winding up on his part with an incantation, or the
working of some anti-witch spell by the injured ones
on their own account at home.</p>

<p>These charms for destroying the power of witches
were numerous; in fact a careless inquirer would be
led to the conclusion that every dale of any size
possessed its own peculiar charm, but after a little
careful research and comparison, such an opinion
will be found to be untenable. The difference exists
only in detail, nearly all springing from one or two
common roots. When and how it came about these
varied alterations crept in, is somewhat of a mystery,
because one would naturally suppose, where such
a vital point was at issue, every word and detail as
to manipulation would be most carefully handed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
down. The only solution I can offer—and I do so
in all humility—is that these charms had their birth
in remote ages. Afterwards local circumstances may
have placed almost insuperable difficulties in the way
of certain details being carried out; others would
then be substituted as nearly approaching to the
original as possible, probably by order of the priest
or wise man. Add to this the fact that a fable told
through long ages in different districts always unconsciously
takes a local colouring, and you have a partial
solution. Still, if the details differ, they do not run
on widely diverging lines; in general they manage
to keep fairly parallel, the main essentials being
always kept well in sight. Whether animate or
inanimate, the <em>thing</em> had to be injured, and then
something burnt; midnight was always the time
chosen for the final part of the ceremony, seclusion,
as far as possible, and absolute silence being
necessary. Many of these rites and ceremonies,
especially in connexion with witchcraft, consisting as
they do of blood, death, and burning by fire, seem
to be all that is left us of what may have been in
remote ages a propitiatory sacrifice to some pagan
god.</p>

<p>Chatting with an old mother one day, she remarked,
‘Aye, things is altered noo. T’ young uns
to’n up ther neeases’ (noses) ’at ommaist ivvery thing
’at yan yance thowt an’ did; tha deea nowt bud mak
gam o’ yan if yan diz tell ’em owt, seea Ah nivver
tells ’em nowt.’ This statement explains much; the
old people nowadays do keep their mouths shut.
It often happens that after an hour’s chat with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
grey-headed occupant of the big armchair, you gain
more information about the doings of days past than
the rest of the household could have given you,
were they even willing to do so, because in many
cases they have little interest in things which ’happen’d
afoor their tahm.’ But, bear in mind, the unsealing
of aged lips can only be accomplished when properly
approached, and a bond of mutual sympathy has
been established; then the lips and hearts will pour
forth such a wealth of bygone lore, that you will
hardly be able to jot down your notes fast enough.</p>

<p>But to return to my old lady. ‘Why,’ said I, ‘when
you were a girl there would be witches, or was that
before your time?’ For the benefit of my readers
I will give the rest of the story literally, but in
standard English. ‘No,’ said she, ‘that it is not. There
was one Dolly Makin; I once saw her myself, but
she will be dead now, for she was over a hundred
then; but my aunt once had a strange bout with
her.’ ‘And where did Dolly live?’ I asked, for I
had years before heard of this same Dolly Makin.
‘Nay, that’s mair ’an Ah can tell ya,’ said she. ‘And
what did she do to your aunt?’ I inquired. ‘Nothing;
she only tried to. It was like this. There was one
Tom Pickles wanted to keep company with my aunt,
but he found out that she had a liking for one William
Purkis. It was always thought, when Tommy found
this out, that he went to the witch and gave her
something to work a spell on my aunt. Anyhow, one
night when she had just finished milking, a fortune-teller
came up and took hold of her hand, and told
her a long story about the carryings-on of William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Purkis and another lass, and she advised my aunt to
take up with Tommy, telling her that things looked
very black for her if she did anything else. But my
aunt said that she would wed who she liked, and
it would not be Tommy. At that the fortune-teller
struck the cow with her stick; the cow lashed out
and knocked the milk-pail over; my aunt flung the
milk-stool at the fortune-teller’s head, but she ducked,
and it missed her, and next moment they were one
grappling with the other like all that. My aunt, however,
was a well-built, strong lass, and after they had
fought for a long time, neither gaining an advantage,
the fortune-teller screamed out that my aunt had
something about her that belonged to the unburied
dead, or otherwise she would have mastered her, and
had her in her power for ever. “But,” said she, as
she walked away, “I have not done with you yet;” and
then my aunt saw it was the old witch. My aunt
did not know what the witch meant by saying she
had something about her that belonged to the unburied
dead; but news came next morning that her
uncle had died the day before, and it happened that
a brooch she was wearing had a bit of his hair
in it. It was that which had saved her. It would
have been useless trying to overtake the witch when
she left her, even on horseback, for she once went
from the top of Ingleborough to the top of Whernside
at one stride.’ ‘But,’ I ventured to say, ‘it is a long
way, that.’ I was not quite sure of the distance, but
I knew I was within bounds when I added, ‘It will
be quite nine miles.’ For a moment the old lady
hesitated; even to her, after making all allowance for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the witch’s marvellous power, it did seem a prodigious
stride. ‘Well,’ she said, with a sigh of relief, as
an idea struck her, ‘maybe I am wrong; it would be
a leap;’ or, as she put it, ‘mebbe Ah’s wrang; sha wad
loup it.’ Again I pointed out that it was an enormous
leap. ‘Deean’t ya want her ti ’a’e deean’t?’ (i.e.
‘Don’t you want her to have done it?’) she questioned,
losing her temper. And then I had to smooth her
ruffled feelings. I knew I was precious near treading
on her pet corn, but I wished to see how, as I knew,
she would explain away the difficulty. ‘Whya, noo,
ez you saay it’s a gertish loup,’ she admitted, and
then added, ‘maist leykly sha wad deea ’t iv a hitch,
strhad, an’ a jump; onny road, sha did it.’ That
being settled, I asked what took place when she
herself saw the witch. ‘Nowt, bud summat might
‘ deean.’ And then she explained that one evening,
a few months before she was married, she and
her sweetheart were walking to Feetham Holme
when they saw an old lady sitting on a great stone.
It seems she looked <em>that sackless</em>, that her sweetheart
burst out laughing. The moment he did that,
the old lady sprang to her feet, and almost shrieked,
‘Ya aren’t wed yet,’ and then disappeared. A
moment afterwards, however, a black cat sprang
across their path, which was a most unlucky omen.
My informant could not say what it was, but something
told her that the black cat was none other
than the old witch. She mentioned none of her
fears to her future husband, but the next day she
paid a visit to the wise man of Reeth. To him she
unburdened herself of all her fears, inquiring what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
would have to be done to break any spell Dolly
might work to prevent her marriage. It seems
there were only two things the wise man knew of
equal to the occasion. One was to tear a piece of
cloth from the garment of a man hanging from a
gibbet, cut it into nine pieces, and burn them
at dead of night, with every door and window
not only closed but securely fastened. This she had
declared to be quite impossible. Her next chance was
to hear the last words of a man just before he was
hanged, write the same on nine pieces of paper,
stick a pin through each piece, and then burn them
at midnight, doors and windows as before. This
she thought might be managed. From a copy of
the <cite>Yorkshire Gazette</cite> which came into the dale every
week, she learnt that a man was to be hanged at York;
so to Settle she went, and thence by the carrier
to her destination. She had a cousin living in York,
with whom she stayed until after the eventful day.
She managed to hear the last words, and carried out
all other injunctions, and so, as she said, ‘Dolly nivver
c’u’d deea nowt nowther ti me ner onny o’ my bairns.’</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that witches have a decided
aversion to a stone with a hole through it. So
one hanging in the house goes a long way towards
keeping them outside; and an old horse-shoe, which
has been picked up and nailed on the door, has even
greater power. Again, any girl, whilst a maiden, who
was so fortunate as to find three horse-shoes in one
year, if she threw them over her left shoulder, and
walked round them three times, being careful to
preserve all three, not only she, but when married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
her children, could never be witch-held. This, be it
observed, only protected the person, it did not extend
to property of any kind.</p>

<p>Dolly Ayre, the Carthorpe witch, died within the
ken of many now living. Richard Kirby, an old
inhabitant of Carthorpe, gave me the following only
a short time ago. I must really give it in his
words. Filling his pipe, he began, ‘Aye! Ah ken’d
her weel; she yance witched sum coos ov au’d
Tommy’s, an’ sha wadn’t tak ’t off.’ I inquired what
it was she would not take off, and was promptly
informed it was ‘summat sha’d deean tiv ’em: a
spell o’ sum soart ’at sha’d warked on ’em.’ Old
Tommy, it seems, hurried off to the wise man, Sammy
Banks o’ Mickly, who, after Tommy’s story had been
told, ‘did summat, an’ Tommy did summat, an’
atween ’em tha baith did summat else ’at completely
flustrated Au’d Dolly intiv a cocked hat, bud
nut afoor sha’d mannished ti spell t’ leyfe oot o’ yan
o’ t’ coos—ya see, iv a waay, sha ’ed t’ fost ho’d.’ On
asking what they had done to master Dolly, he
replied, with a shake of his head, ‘Naay, noo, Ah deean’t
knaw; that war kept a dark secret. All ’at ivver war
knawn, war ’at Tommy ’ed driven a peg o’ wickenwood
inti summat, an’ ‘at he’d thrussen summat thruff
t’ au’d witch’s latch slit, but what it war no man
nivver knew, bud it mun ’a’e been summat varra larl,
or else he c’u’dn’t ’a’e thrussen ’t thruff, an’ he bo’nt’
(burnt) ‘summat at midneet ’at stank warse ’an nowt.
Aye! an’ noo ther war yance a queer thing happen’d
at Ness, near Pickhill.’ A man, it seems, took a farm
over the head of the then tenant. The man who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
been so shabbily treated had once done a great kindness
to Dolly, though, according to my informant, it
was a most risky thing to offer a kindness to a witch,
as they might take offence even at that. However,
in the case mentioned, the kindness had been
graciously accepted. When the new-comers arrived
with their goods and chattels, they found written in
blood-red writing on every door and shutter, these
words, <span class="smcap">Bad Luck</span>; there was also something written
underneath, which no man could make out. ‘Aye,’
said the old man, in words which there was no gainsaying,
‘an’ afoor they’d gitten hauf ther sticks in,
doon cam a lahtle bit ov a shelf they’d putten sum
pans on, an’ it tumm’l’d reet on t’ top o’ yan o’ ther
bairns, an’ killed it wheer it stood, an’ ther’s neea
gitting ower that; noo, is theer?’</p>

<p>In this same Carthorpe, years ago, one of the houses
was suspected of being witch-held, and everything
about the place witch-stricken, and for some time
neither land nor beast throve. It happened that one
who possessed the power of smelling witches slept for
a night under this particular roof. In the morning
he said they were quite mistaken in supposing the
house was witch-held, declaring that it was haunted.
He advised them to prevail upon the parson to shout
it down. The then Rector of Burneston, having been
seen, kindly undertook the shouting down of the said
spirit. To this end he partook of a good meal, rested
for an hour, and then betook himself to the farmer’s
well. There he read something out of the Prayer
Book, which ‘incanted t’ spirit up ti t’ wellsahd,’ and
then the parson called out, ‘For ever and for ay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>’
to which the spirit replied, ‘For a year and a day.’
Then the parson at it again, and the spirit did the
same, ‘and they baith went at it leyke all that foor
ower tweea hoors, bud t’ parson gat t’ last wo’d acoz
t’ spirit c’u’dn’t ho’d oot neea langer, an’ seea t’ parson
wan t’ battle i’ t’ end, an’ cungled it doon; an’ seea that
spirit nivver na mair, at noa tahm, ivver agaan c’u’d
cum oot o’ t’ bad pleeace ti wark ill agaan neeabody<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>.’</p>

<p>For some unexplained reason, witches held in great
aversion posthumous children, more especially male
children. In fact their malevolence was often made
manifest prior to the child’s birth. An old dame
gave me the following as having occurred years ago
at Kirby Hill, near Boroughbridge. A young couple,
recently married, met the witch (Sally Carey) near
the Devil’s Arrows. What they had done to gain
Sally’s displeasure, legend does not say, but as they
passed the old lady she shook her stick, and almost
screamed, ‘Ya want a lad, bud Ah’ll mak it a lass’;
and sure enough, when the baby arrived, it was a girl.
They had hoped it would be a boy, for much future
fortune depended upon their having a son and heir.
Still they hoped, should they be blest with a further
addition, that the next arrival would be a boy. Three
or four months after the birth of their daughter, the
husband was thrown off his horse and killed.</p>

<p>Some time after the sad event, and late in the
evening, Sally knocked at the widow’s door; on its
being opened, the old hag screamed, brandishing her
stick in the widow’s face, ‘It shan’t be a lad this tahm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
nowther.’ So terrified was her victim that she fainted,
and was found some time afterwards in a doubled-up
position and unable to rise. By-and-by, when
sufficiently recovered, her friends strongly urged her
to pay a visit to the wise man of Aldborough.
At last she was prevailed upon to do so, when a
supreme effort on his part was made to break the
witch’s power. Much of what the wise man did,
the old lady had forgotten. All she remembered
was that at midnight, with closed doors and windows,
a black cat and a black cock bird were roasted to
a cinder, on a fire made from boughs of the rowan-tree;
a long incantation was also pronounced, of which
she could not call to mind a single word, for as she
put it, ‘wa war all ti freetened.’ The ’all’ consisted
of the widow, my informant—then a maiden—and
a mother of seven sons, the trio being necessary for
the working of the charm. When the baby was born,
it was a boy, but a cripple. Once again the wise man
was visited. This time the almost heart-broken mother
was assured that, if she remained unwedded for seven
years, her son would outlive his weakness, his back
would grow straight, and all would be well. This
demand was readily complied with. ‘But,’ added the
old dame, ‘t’ au’d witch tried all maks an’ manders
o’ waays ti git her ti wed. Ah nivver knaw’d a lass seea
pesthered wi’ chaps iv all mah leyfe. Sha’ (the witch)
‘war awlus sending some good leyke leeaking chap
for ti ’tice her, bud sha kept single, and bested t’ au’d
witch i’ t’ end, fer t’ bairn grew up ti be ez straight
an’ strang a chap ez yan need wish ti clap yan’s e’es
on. Ah mahnd him weel, an’ ther’s nowt aboot that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<p>Only the other day I met an old fellow who firmly
believed not only in the power of witches, but that
they existed at the present day. He held that the
evil eye accounted for many mishaps, which ‘fooak
c’u’dn’t account for nooadays neea road at all.’ Of
witches he had known several, but of fairies he
could only speak from hearsay. ‘Nobbut sum fooak,’
explained he, ‘war yabble ti see t’ fairies’; he had never
possessed that power; but he continued, ‘Ah’ve knawn
fooak ’at ’ez seean ’em monny a tahm, bud that’s years
sen noo.’ He had come to the conclusion that as
people had got so into the way of saying there were
no such things, ‘tha ’ed all ta’en t’ hig, an’ takken
thersens fo’ther up t’ dale; bud tha cum back sumtahms
ti t’ au’d spots, acoz yan offens sees t’ rings
wheear tha’ve danced owerneet. Onnybody can see t’
rings fer thersens if tha nobbut tak ther een aboot wiv
’em; bud,’ said he, emphatically, ‘Ah think ’at tha mun
awlus keep ther heead-gear on noo.’ I was given to
understand that so long as a fairy kept its cap or
bonnet on it was invisible, but this, I think, is a bit
of lore gone wrong; he ought to have said, so long
as they keep their invisible caps on, &amp;c. This old
chap gave me a bit of lore which was quite new
to me.</p>

<p>We all know that witches kept a black cat, and as
a rule it was a Thomas cat; but if, to work something
especially evil, a witch took to keeping a black tabby,
she was, by some higher power, compelled to keep
that tabby until it had kittens. When this interesting
event was about to come off, the said tabby was
securely locked up and guarded until the expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
increase arrived; immediately this happened, the whole
lot were drowned. The reason for this hurried departure
of mother cat and kitten babies from the land
of the living was made quite clear. For had the
witch a son when the kittens were born, and any person
managed to steal one of the said kittens, the witch
from that moment became a ’bustard,’ being bereft
of all power to work evil; but if up to that time she
had only given birth to girls, she remained a bustard
only until a son was born; then all power was restored
to her. My informant remembers a witch who was
made a bustard of, and who never again regained
power to work evil, being too old at the time to dream
of having a son.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most widely adopted anti-witch charm
was that of sticking a beast’s heart full of pins and roasting
the same at midnight, being careful to observe the
rule of closed doors and windows, absolute silence, and
the refusal to admit any one during the performance of
the rite; this, however, will be referred to by-and-by.</p>

<p>I think it must be put on record that witches
sometimes did good even if they committed evil to
bring it about. To do this, I shall have to step just
over the boundary of the North into the West Riding.
There was a widow residing in the village of Aldfield,
whose son, her only support, lay at death’s door: he,
so I was informed, was afflicted with a disease which
was consuming his vitals. After the matter had been
fully discussed by the neighbours, the consuming of
his vitals was pronounced to be the result of a bad
wish, the evil eye, or a witch spell, and, according to
their verdict, one Nanny Appleby was suspected of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
being the spell-worker. Nanny lived somewhere on
the other side of Dalla Moor. This must have been
before the days of the wise man of Mickley, or
assuredly thither the widow would have gone. It
seems that the poor mother screwed up courage to
seek Nanny out herself, hoping to appease her—an
almost hopeless task. Anyway, early one morning
off she set; fortunately she met the old witch before
she had completed half her journey.</p>

<p>On being questioned, Nanny swore she was innocent,
but declared she knew what ailed the lad,
and offered to go back with her and cure him. In
much fear and trembling, the widow returned with
Nanny, to the astonishment of the whole village.
After having been left alone with the young fellow
for some little time, Nanny told the weeping mother
that her lad was possessed of a devil, which she promised
to drive out. By what means she managed to
induce the devil to let go his hold ’of the vitals’ is
not known; but a terrific fight took place, furniture
was smashed and pots were broken, amidst yells
Satanic, and Nanny came off victorious. Having
got the devil out of the young fellow, the next
thing was, what must be done with the little imp?
Nanny, however, seems to have been equal to the
occasion. Of course such a doubtful customer could
not be allowed to roam about at his own sweet
will; oh dear no, Nanny would not grant a favour
of that kind. The spirit was commanded to enter
the body of a certain Tom Moss. Probably she
had a spite against Tom; anyway the order seems to
have been most promptly obeyed, for within a month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
Tom was found drowned in Grantley Lake. The invalid
recovered, and so there is no doubt about anything.</p>

<p>The following witch story unfortunately is wanting
in one or two points of interest. I am unable to give
the witch’s name, or with certainty her dwelling-place.
One or two things, however, tend to the belief that
she was the Ayton witch, who flourished about 1750-80.
If in this I am correct, she was known as Au’d
Nanny; and though a native of Stokesley, she lived
for many years in a tumble-down old cottage in
the far corner of the green near the mill at Great
Ayton.</p>

<p>Though doubtless a terror in her day, nearly all
her deeds, like herself, have passed away. Two or
three stories are yet told concerning Au’d Nanny,
but they are unauthenticated and of doubtful origin.
They seem to me most like latter-day ghost stories
told to terrify children, with Nanny’s name tacked on
to them. They preserve her memory and christian
name, and that is all.</p>

<p>One story, however, I had from an old lady whose
grandmother once had an encounter with Au’d
Nanny. As the story was told to me in that matter-of-fact
way which leaves small room for imagination
to exploit itself, I have no doubt it was repeated, for
my benefit, as her mother or grandmother had told
it her years before. The main interest of the story lies
in the fact that it contains a witch’s curse, and sets
forth the proposition that a witch had the power
not only of assuming the form of one recently dead,
but could even inhabit the body itself.</p>

<p>To divest the story of much repetition and redun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>dancy,
it will be better to keep mainly to ordinary
English.</p>

<p>It seems that her grandmother lived at Stokesley,
and had a cousin living at Kildale, to whom she was
deeply attached. This cousin’s name was Martha
Sokeld. One day Martha was taken very ill, and
sent for her cousin Mary Langstaff to come at once
and nurse her. Mary sent word back she would be
along directly; so after she had cleaned up and ‘putten
things ti reets,’ she put on her hood and shawl and
set off to walk to Kildale—‘an’ it’s a goodish step an’
all, Ah can tell ya; an’ ther’s nowt aboot that.’ Well,
when Mary had walked above halfway, she saw an
old woman ’hoppling alang t’ road.’ It seems there
was something about the old lady which struck Mary
as curious—‘sha didn’t leyke t’ leeak on her.’ What
it was which made her feel certain the old body
approaching was none other than ’t’ au’d witch<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>,’
she never could tell, but such became her conviction.
So, to avoid the necessity of speaking to her, she
stooped down and commenced to cull flowers from
the hedge side. But on the old witch drawing near,
she called out in a creaking voice, ‘Thoo’s neea call
ti hing thi heead doon i’ that waay. Ah ken tha, Mary
Langstaff, reet weel; aye, ez weel ez if thoo ow’d
ma summat. Noo, ’t wadn’t ’a’e cossen<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> tha mich
ti ’a’e passed t’ tahm o’ daay wi’ ma; bud sitha,
Ah s‘an’t forgit ti-daay, an’ Ah knaw all ’at thoo
off’ns sez aboot ma an’ all; but Ah’ll paay tha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
oot for ’t, Ah’ll paay tha oot for ’t.’ She then banged
the ground three times with her stick, and when my
informant’s grandmother looked up, the witch had
disappeared. The reason why the witch did not do
her an injury at that time was easily accounted for—she
happened to be wearing in her bosom a bunch of
wicken-tree, i.e. mountain ash, berries.</p>

<p>On arriving at her cousin’s, she found her almost
recovered. She stayed with her a few days and
then returned to Stokesley—this was on a Monday
afternoon. Much to her surprise, who should walk in
on Wednesday evening but Martha Sokeld. Martha
told her she had had another bad bout, and felt
she was not going to last long, but before she died
she would like to see her sister who lived at Northallerton.
She had got a ride so far on the way that
afternoon, and then, after a night’s rest, she thought she
would be able to go by the carrier to Northallerton.
Just then she felt very tired, and thought if Mary
would go over to Hannah’s and get her to put some
things together which she wished to send to her sister,
she could manage to get a nap lying on the settle.
She was most pressing that Mary should not hurry
back, but stop a good hour, giving as an excuse—she did
not wish to be ‘wakken’d efter sha ’ed yance
gitten ti sleep.’ Mary went to Hannah’s, but there
was a something that made her feel very uneasy—she
did not know what it was; ‘an’ i’ t’ end it gat sike
a grip on her, ‘at sha left an’ set off yam agaan.’
So that she should not awaken her cousin if she
had fallen asleep, she approached the house very
quietly; and peeping between the shutters (they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
not fit very closely), she beheld a sight which made
her ’oppen wide baith e’es’—her cousin, instead of being
asleep, was sitting in front of a blazing fire, dropping
things into a pan ‘an’ saying ower an’ up agaain’—</p>

<p>Something seemed to say to Mary, ‘Sha’s working
a curse on thee an’ Tom’ (Tom was her sweetheart).
‘Thoo mun deea summat, or sha’ll mak mischief atween
ya.’ So Mary opened the door and walked boldly in.
She then told the witch—for by this time she had no
doubt her visitor was such—that she had heard all she
had said, and seen all she had done. She then took
hold of the Bible, and said, ‘Ya mun deea yer warst;
Ah ho’d byv this,’ meaning the Bible. No sooner had
she said that she had heard and seen all, and declared
that she held by the Bible, and dared her to do her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
worst, than the witch turned the pan wrong side up
on the fire, and shrieking out, ‘Thoo’s ’scaped ma this
tahm, bud Ah’ll mell on tha yet,’ disappeared. Early
next morning a man rode over from Kildale, with the
news that Martha Sokeld was nowhere to be found,
and it was not until three days afterwards that her
dead body was discovered on the moor head. The
conclusion come to at that time (and which my informant
thought most probable) was that the witch had
lured Martha on to the moor and then spelled the soul
out of her, taking possession of the body herself, and
so deceived her grandmother. However, her grandmother
lived until she was eighty-five, having brought
up a large family; and so, as the old lady put it, ‘Efter
that t’ au’d witch ’ed nivver been yabble ti deea owt
tiv her; sha aiblins off’ns aim’d ti deea, bud it seeams
’at it nivver cam tiv a heead.’</p>

<p>The following further information regarding Molly
Cass, the Leeming witch, of whom mention has been
made, was given to me by Abe Braithwaite, a noted
character of Bedale twenty-five years ago. Molly,
although a native of Exelby, lived for many years
in a cottage close to Leeming Mill: some declare in
a disused part of the mill itself. Be that as it may,
one night whilst the miller, two others, and Abe’s
grandfather were playing cards in the mill, George
Winterfield (one of the players) had the nine of hearts
dealt to him eight times in succession. As the ninth
deal was proceeding, one of the players laid a guinea on
the table, offering to wager Winterfield that amount to
a shilling, that the nine of hearts did not fall to his
hand that deal. ‘Put thi brass i’ thi pocket,’ said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Au’d Molly, popping her head just inside the door;
‘thi brass is nut foor him, an’ his brass is nut foor thee.
Put thi brass i’ thi pocket, an’ leeak sharp aboot it.’
So terrified was the owner of the guinea of gaining
the ill-will of Molly, that he pocketed his guinea
at once. When the last card of the deal fell, and
whilst the cards still lay on the table, Molly said,
‘Thoo’s gitten ’t again, George; tak thi han’ up and
see,’ and such turned out to be the case. ‘Aye,
thoo’s gitten it hard eneeaf, an’ thoo’s had it eight
times alriddy; t’ au’d un’s<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> i’ tha noo, an’ he’ll nut
leeav tha whahl he’s gitten tha altogither. Thoo hed
thi chance, an’ thoo wadn’t tak’t, seea Ah’ve potched
it inti t’ Swale’ (the name of the river hard by), ‘an’
thoo’ll ’a’e ti gan theer ti late it. T’ Swale’s waiting ti
be thi brahdal bed. Thoo’d better gan noo; think on
t’ langer thoo waits, an’ t’ langer thoo’ll stay<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>.’ On
hearing this, George, turning as white as chalk, arose,
saying, ‘Ah’ll wed her; Ah’ll mak an honest woman
on her, if thoo’ll nobbut gi’e ma anuther chance; Ah’ve
rewd all ’at Ah’ve deean.’ To which Molly replied,
‘Ah’s nut off’ns i’ t’ mahnd o’ gi’ing onnybody yah
chance, let aleean tweea; thoo sez ’at thoo’ll tak her ti
thi bed, Ah’ve sed ’at thoo s’all gan tiv hers. Noo,
then, gan thi waays; thi brahd’s waiting foor tha, sha’s
ligging asleep on a bed o’ bulls an’ segs. Oh, what a
brahdal bed! Oh, what a brahdal bed!’ she screamed,
banging to the door.</p>

<p>Winterfield left the company, saying he would go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
at once to his old sweetheart and promise to marry
her. The night was intensely dark, and whether
he missed his way and slipped into the beck,
which was much swollen at the time, and his body
drifted into the Swale, or whether it was as Molly
shouted to him as he left, ‘Good-neet, George, all
roads leead ti t’ Swale ti-neet,’ it is impossible to say.
One thing, however, is certain—though he joined his
old sweetheart, he never saw her again. It was as
a corpse the current carried him along, and left his
body late that night by the side of her, who, only
a few hours before, in a fit of desperation and despair,
had confided to the silent waters the whole of her
sin and shame. Both bodies were found quite close
together, tightly held by the ‘bulls and segs,’ in the backwater
where the beck joins the Swale. I well remember,
when fishing near the spot late in the evening for
eels, an old lady remarking on what she considered
my temerity, for she fully believed that any one who
ventured near at midnight would see the dead body
of a girl, and presently that of a man, float by, both
being quite visible until they joined each other in
the high seaves and bulrushes.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>WITCHCRAFT—<i>continued</i></small></h2>


<p>So far as we have gone, it will be evident to those
who read a little between the lines, that mixed up
with fact, imagination, and exaggeration, there exists
a very considerable amount of respectable myth.
But to which of the ancient myths we owe many of
the stories told in connexion with our local witches,
is often somewhat difficult to determine; but certain
it is that nearly all of them possessed the power, so
common to those of an earlier date, of changing themselves
into some animal, the hare and cat being the
favourite forms which they assumed when hard
pressed. Very similar stories exhibiting this power
are told of the following well-known local witches,
all of whom flourished during the present century:—Peggy
Flaunders, of Marske-by-the-Sea; Bessy Slack,
of West Burton, Wensleydale; Nanny Pearson, of
Goathland; the Guisborough witch, Ann Grear; Nan
Hardwicke, of Spittal Houses; Au’d Nanny, of Great
Ayton; Nanny Howe, of Kildale; and Nanny Newgill,
of Broughton and Stokesley. Then there was Dolly
Makin and Au’d Mother Stebbins, who seem to have
had no regular place of abode, but tramped the
country with a few small wares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>Of these and others, pretty much the same stories
are told, differing only in slight details. These also
bear a very strong resemblance to others current in
different parts of Europe, but of much earlier times.
Then, too, we have their malicious attacks on the
dairy, either in the form of spoiling or purloining the
produce, or in surreptitiously milking the cows, though
the latter was more prevalent further north, and often
practised by the German witches. But in the exercise
of the evil eye, and in the committal of all manner
of evil acts, our North Riding witches held a position
second to none.</p>

<p>Again, the methods used to overcome their power
and break their spells, as has been said, runs very
much on the same lines throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Peggy Flaunders died in 1835, at the age of eighty-five,
and was buried in the churchyard at Marske-by-the-Sea.</p>

<p>Many old people have a lively remembrance of
Peggy, with her tall hat and red cloak; and the stories
which are told to-day of the pranks she played and
the wonders she worked, make us open our eyes with
amazement, because we are not listening to the marvellous
deeds of some person who lived in mediaeval
times, but of one who lived amongst those now living.
Do you wish to hear of her doings from one who
knew her? then find your way to Boyes Wetherell’s
cottage, and have a chat with the old worthy, and
you will have such an outpouring of ancient
customs, rites, lore, smuggling stories, and the doings
of days gone by, together with touches of his own
eventful life, as will stock your mind with information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
such as it is only possible to obtain from an original
source<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>.</p>

<p>But of Peggy and her doings.</p>

<p>On one occasion Peggy is said to have cast a spell
against one Tom Pearson (who lived on a farm near
Marske), and every head of cattle he possessed died.
Whether this ruined him or not, is not known, but he
left the farm, and his cousin took it. As this cousin
crossed the threshold for the first time, Peggy passed
by. (This cousin, it seems, had once befriended
Peggy.) She called out to him as she passed, ‘Thoo
’ez mah good wishes,’ and with that she turned three
times round, threw her cloak on the ground, jumped
over it, mumbled something, and walked away, and
from that day everything prospered ’awlus wiv him.’</p>

<p>For three weeks in succession, Hannah Rothwell’s
butter didn’t come rightly, churn as long as she might;
and at the same time Mary Parker, her next-door
neighbour, began to get very little milk from her cow.
These two old worthies having talked the matter over,
decided they would pay a visit to Jonathan Westcott
of Upleatham, a wise man of that day<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>. Jonathan, on
hearing what they had to say, declared it was all
owing to Peggy’s malice. So far as Mrs. Rothwell
was concerned, she was told to return home, scald her
churn out three times, first with boiling water, in
which a handful of salt had been dissolved; secondly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
with boiling water in which a handful of wicken-tree
berries had been thrown; and, thirdly, with a large
amount of plain boiling water. She had also to get
two small wickenwood pegs and drive them into each
end of the churn, and whilst turning the churn with the
last filling of water, she had to repeat, as she pretended
to look if the butter was coming,—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">This tahm it’s thahn,</div>
  <div class="verse">T’ next tahm it’s mahn,</div>
  <div class="verse indent6">An’ mahn foor ivver mair.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This had to be repeated nine times, giving nine
turns before repeating the lines, when the churn
would be found to be all right. At least it would
be quite clean, and that is needful for the making
of good butter. The milk case was a much more
difficult one to tackle. However, after Jonathan had
consulted his almanack, and seen what direction and
position the heavenly bodies were in—he was great
on the planetary world—he advised the following:
first, a good drench<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> must be given the cow, followed
by gentle exercise; secondly, it was not to be milked
to its full yield for nine days, but on the tenth, before
seating herself to milk, Mary had to whisper in the
cow’s ear, ‘Ah’s milking tha foor Peggy Flaunders.’
The cow would then yield its proper quantity. This
pious fraud of deliberately whispering tarradiddles
into the cow’s ear had to be continued indefinitely.
On the other hand, if after having so whispered Mary
drew no more milk than usual, Jonathan declared
Peggy had nothing to do with the case, that she would
be free from all suspicion of milking the cow at home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
by magic art, and that it was nothing ’neea warse ’an
that t’ au’d coo war a larl bit oot o’ fettle, an’ wad
mebbins cum roond iv a bit; if nut, sha mud git shut
on’t sumhoo.’</p>

<p>On one occasion some sportsmen, coursing in the
old close field at the top end of Marske, put up
a hare, which was recognized as one the dogs had
often tried unsuccessfully to capture. Peggy’s son
was one of the company. The lad, it seems, had
heard his mother say no hare could escape their
black bitch, but he was to be very careful not to
mention the fact, and never to slip it at one without
her consent. In the excitement the lad disregarded
his mother’s commands, and repeated what she had
said. The black bitch was slipped, and, after an
exciting chase, seized the hare by the haunch just
as it was trying to enter Peggy’s worral hole<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>. On
Peggy being examined, teeth-marks were found on
a corresponding part of her body.</p>

<p>The Guisborough witch, Jane Grear, was perhaps
more widely known than Peggy. She, like Peggy, was
bitten by a dog, and bore the marks until the day
of her death. She received her injuries when trying
to jump through her own key-hole: it must have been
either a very small hare she had turned herself into,
or she must have owned an abnormally large key-hole;
but this is a matter of detail. Whatever Jane may
have been like in the decline of her life, in her youthful
days she must have been quite a good-looking girl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
There are two old rhymes still remembered, one of
which tells of her various charms, perhaps a little
too freely. So much into detail does it go, that
only a few lines can possibly be given. The second
recounts a mighty hunt which once took place.</p>

<p>It would seem that Jane, like Peggy, occasionally

The lines, however, which are given are valuable, show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>ing

<p>I know a very similar set of verses exist, telling
of a wonderful run after a hare in connexion with
Bilsdale and that district. But the language, in fact
the whole tone of the rhyme, is much too loose for
the publication of any part of it.</p>

<p>A word here explaining what is meant by witches
milking cows may not be out of place. It has been
mentioned that Peggy Flaunders was thought to have
drawn the milk from one Mary Parker’s cow. How
or by what means, deponent sayeth not, but one
Ann Allan, of Ugthorpe, who kept pigs, was almost
caught in the act. This was about 1780, and as Ann’s
procedure was run on much the same lines as the
most respectable witches used some hundreds of years
before her time, we may take hers as a typical
example.</p>

<p>Not one, but three or four Ugthorpe cows ceased
to give their usual quantity of milk. Of course the
villagers talked, and at last the priest was visited;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
but a hundred years ago many of the clergy, both
of Rome and the Church of England, so far as
learning was concerned, would have been knocked
into a cocked hat by a Primitive Methodist local
brother of these days. So it will be readily conceived
the visit to the priest resulted in very little good. He
declared the devil had got hold of the defaulting cows
by the tail, and this made them hold their milk back;
he further assured them the only way to get the
devil to let go was to say three pater nosters and
Ave Marias over their milk-pails, and to subscribe a
certain sum, which had to be paid to him, to celebrate
a mass to Saint somebody, who would send a holy
angel to frighten the devil away. Now, I know
nothing about doctoring cows, but I am inclined to
the belief that old Jonathan Westcott, of Upleatham,
was much nearer effecting a cure, when he ordered
an aperient draught, to be followed by gentle
exercise, than prayers muttered inside any number
of milk-cans.</p>

<p>I believe the good people of that day would have
fallen in with the prayers, but they drew a hard and
fast line when the collection box obtruded itself.
They returned home dissatisfied. They were losing
their milk—that they could not help; but they could
prevent their pockets being dipped into, and they did.
Another meeting was held, and a watch was set on
Ann, but nothing came of it. At last a neighbour’s
cow dried up altogether. At this the good man was so
exasperated, that he went to Ann’s and boldly accused
her of milking the cows. Words ran high, till in the
end he seized a three-legged stool, intending to hurl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
it at Ann’s head, when, lo! a curious thing happened—as
he gripped the leg of the stool, a stream of milk
ran from it. The neighbours, who by this time had
flocked round the door, cried out with one voice:
‘Thoo’s gitten ’t; that’s what sha milks wer coos wi’.’
And sure enough such was found to be the case. On
the name of any neighbour’s cow being mentioned, and
a leg of the stool handled as in milking, a fine stream
of milk came from it, and the bag of that individual’s
cow was found on examination to have shrunk. No
wonder she had fat pigs, when she could give them
new milk in any quantity and from any one’s cow she
liked to name. Such a stool was not a fit piece of
furniture for any one to possess, so it was publicly
burnt on the moor just beyond the high end of the
village, near to where the windmill stands. Ann was
ordered to walk three times from one end of the
village to the other, clothed in nothing but her sark<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>,
i.e. chemise. The Godivan rule, which compelled
every one to keep within doors during the time of
penance, seems (so far as Ugthorpe was concerned)
to have been absolutely reversed—they were all there,
even down to the babies in arms. From all accounts,
Ugthorpe has never had quite such a lively time
since. Before judging the people and the ways of
that time as altogether too idiotic, indecent, and
unjust, it is as well to bear in mind that every age
has its curious idiosyncrasies. In 1898 affiliation cases
are heard in open court; a man may nearly kick the
life out of his wife with a pair of clogs at a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
outlay of about seven-and-six; but stealing a turnip
necessitates a low form of diet, and enforced seclusion
for three months. These masterpieces of our time
will bring a smile to faces yet unborn.</p>

<p>Nan Hardwicke’s fame at one time was great, and
her name and deeds still live in many of the Cleveland
dales. I remember once being driven to Westerdale
by an old chap, who gave me the following story. I
think the circumstance occurred to his father, and not
himself—on this point my notes are silent, anyway.
Either his mother or his wife was expecting the advent
of a new baby, and the expectant mother’s sister had
to be sent for, to some place about five miles distant.
That afternoon Nan Hardwicke called as she was
passing (she must have been some miles from home),
and asked for ’a shive o’ breead an’ a pot o’ beer,’
which were given her. Nan let them know she was
aware of all that was about to transpire. Finishing
her food, she opened the door of the room where the
wife was lying, and poking her head inside, said, ‘Ah
wish ya weell; ya’ll ’ev a lad afoor morning, an’ ya’ll
call him Tommy, weean’t ya?’ ‘Whya, wa ’a’e made
up wer mahnds ti call him John,’ replied the wife.
‘Aye, mebbe, bud ya’d best call him Tommy; an’
thanking ya, Ah’ll be saying good-daay ti ya.’ And
with that she closed the door and departed. The
husband, on being made acquainted with the witch’s
request, declared that nothing of the sort should
happen—John they had decided to call the bairn, and
John it should be—he dare not run the risk of changing
its name then. About six o’clock that evening the
husband put his horse in the gig, or whatever he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
had, and drove away to bring back the sister-in-law.
About three miles on the journey, he had to cross
a small bridge, but when within twenty or thirty
yards of it, the horse stopped, and could not be persuaded
to move a step further. The good man at last
decided to get out and lead the mare over, but in this
he was wrong. Much to his amazement, he discovered
he could not leave his seat—he was ‘ez fast ez owt.’
Vainly did he strive, but it was of no use. At last he
came to the conclusion that a spell was on them both,
so he called out, ‘Noo, Nan, what’s ti eftther? this is
thi wark.’ Immediately he heard Nan commence to
laugh, and then she shouted, but he did not know
where the voice came from, ‘Thoo’ll call t’ bairn
Tommy, weean’t ta?’ The husband was desperately
bold for those days, for he shouted, ‘Neea, Ah weean’t,
nowther foor thoo na all t’ Nan divils i’ t’ country.’
‘Then thoo’ll bahd wheer thoo is, whahl t’ bairn’s born
an’ t’ muther dees,’ croaked Nan. This, in its way,
was a bit of a clincher, to sit stuck fast in a gig,
neither able to proceed nor get out, at a time too
when all speed was necessary; add to this a sinister
threat of immediate death of the one he most loved,
unless he consented to christen an unborn child
Tommy, when he had decided to name it Johnny,
and with a feeling at the bottom of his heart that
there was a margin for uncertainty, and that after
all it might happen to be a girl. Taking all these
things into consideration, was it to be wondered that
he gave way, and swore the child, if a boy, should
be christened Tom? Having made this promise, he
was allowed to proceed on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>But Nan did not always have her own way. She
had a habit of hiding herself amongst the whins and
brackens, which grew in abundance near her humble
roof. The young men used to collect all the hounds
together and put them on the scent of Au’d Nan.
According to legend, they had many a good run, ‘bud
tha nivver catch’d her.’ One other unrecorded story
of Nan<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>.</p>

<p>Nan had a relation living at Lowna Bridge, to
whom she occasionally paid a visit. This relation,
I believe, only looked forward with pleasure to Nan’s
departure. On this point, however, Nan seems to have
been pretty thick-skinned. It is a mystery how this
journey was accomplished. Some thought she turned
herself into a hare and ran the distance of twenty
miles easily in that form; anyway, the fact remains
that now and again Au’d Nan turned up at Lowna
Bridge. It may, <i lang="fr">en passant</i>, be mentioned that human
nature was very much the same in the early part of
this century as it is to-day. I mean, poor relations
are never welcome; their presence, or anything which
calls them to mind, makes one feel we ought to do
something which we had very much rather not do—their
presence digs the spur into one’s conscience, you
know! But to return to Nan and her Lowna relations.
I believe the following occurred on her last
visit: she arrived just after the bridal procession of
the daughter of the house had returned from church.
By-and-by the question arose—where could Au’d Nan
sleep? On this particular occasion every bed had more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
than one claimant already. The matter was solved by
a kindly bridesmaid offering to take Nan home and
share her bed with her, and then bring her back when
the guests had departed. Unfortunately, the bride,
not knowing that Nan was near, said to her friend,
‘Relation though the old thing is, I would not sleep
with her for anything.’ At this Nan turned round
and, before the whole company, exclaimed, ‘Neea, bud
thoo wad sleep wi’ him,’ pointing to the bridegroom;
and then she added, shaking her stick,—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ah’ve let tha be wedded,</div>
  <div class="verse">Bud Ah’ll stop tha being bedded;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and so saying, turned about and left the house.
Good cheer and bonny bridesmaids soon banished
any gloom the old lady’s words for the moment had
cast over the party.</p>

<p>Late that evening, after the bride had retired to
rest, one of the bridesmaids, sister of the bridegroom,
whispered to him, that it would be useless trying
to join his bride by way of the stairs, as there
was a plot on foot to keep him with the revellers
the night long—not an uncommon thing in those
days—it often needing all the scheming of bride
and bridesmaids, to outwit the well-laid plots of the
bucks of those gay old times. The plan which the
bridesmaids had arranged for the bridegroom’s
escape, was that a game of blindman’s-buff should be
played, and on a given signal a maiden was to call
out, ‘Kiss the girl you love in the dark’; on this
being said, every candle was to be blown out, and
the bridegroom had to seize the opportunity to escape.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
A ladder had been placed underneath the bride’s
window, and although it was a little short, the bridesmaids
had tied a long towel to the window-sash, by
which he could pull himself through the window.
Everything worked splendidly until he was just going to
pull himself up by the towel, when some half-intoxicated
idiot discovered he was escaping, and pulled the ladder
from underneath him, bringing him to the ground
with an awful bang. The poor fellow, on being carried
into the house, was found to have broken his leg. The
old lady was right after all. It seems they did have
their little excitements in the good old days of yore—in
these days it is a shower of rice<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> and an old
shoe.</p>

<p>Wrightson, the wise man of Stokesley, although he
died about seventy years ago, has left such a record
behind as few men in his position ever build up to
their credit<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>. He was known as the wise man of
Stokesley. He was the seventh son of a seventh
daughter; and whether such a concatenation of circumstances
lift a man out of the ordinary rut, I am
not in a position to say. But judging Wrightson
from the lips of those who knew him—they are all
about gone now—or from those who have heard of
him from their parents, one cannot but come to the
conclusion, that he was undoubtedly a man endowed
with marvellous psychic power, and with the smallest
amount of charlatanry possible. In fact, all agree in
testifying to the fact that he claimed nothing beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
the power which belonged to all such as are born
under similar circumstances; and that sort of thing
was fully believed in then, and, I might add, is yet, for
the matter of that.</p>

<p>In dealing with such a celebrity—for such he was,
his fame extending far beyond the boundary of the
North Riding—one cannot be too particular as to
the source from whence information is obtained. Fortunately,
years ago, I knew an old Yorkshireman,
already alluded to—William Scorer, a native of Basedale,
but who for some years kept an inn at Fearby
above Masham. During the time I knew him, he
was the landlord of the Fleece, Bedale. He personally
knew Wrightson.</p>

<p>Take the following as examples of the man’s
marvellous power. A friend of Scorer<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> had bought
several head of cattle at Northallerton fair. These
had to be driven to Stokesley; to this end they were
given in charge of an old drover who was driving a
lot to the same place for another buyer. The drover,
arriving late at night, put the two droves into a field
about a quarter of a mile on the other side of
Stokesley, but in the morning two of Scorer’s beasts
were missing; the drover declared they were all there
when he gated them the night before. A suspicion
somehow arose that the old chap had sold them on
the way, and pocketed the money. At that time they
were altogether without any proof that he had done
anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The only way to discover if their surmises were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
correct, was to visit Wrightson. But to put the wise
man’s power to the test, they decided to say it was a
horse they had lost; arguing, if he really knew anything
that could help them, he would find out the
trick which was being played upon him. On entering
his cottage, and before they could speak, Wrightson
shouted from the scullery, where he was washing himself,
‘Noo then, if you chaps is sharp eneaaf, an’ ez that
mich off’ (i.e. know that much) ‘’at ya can manish
ti to’n tweea coos intiv a hoss, it’s neea ewse cumin’ ti
me, foor Ah can’t to’n a hoss back inti tweea coos, an’
seea ya’d better mak yersens scarce. Ah’ve nowt ti
saay ti ya.’ And for some time the wise man was past
all persuasion. In the end he shouted, without leaving
the scullery, ‘Tha’re baith i’ t’ beck, an’ tha’ve been theer
sen yester neet.’ And sure enough both their bodies
were found a good mile below the bridge; evidently
they had missed the bridge when being driven over
late the night before, and had both been drowned
in the Leven, which was much swollen by recent
rain. Here, as in many other stories told of the
marvellous man, was an evidence of foreknowledge;
and many of them rest upon what must be admitted to
be very reliable testimony, and vouched for by most
respectable people of that time<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>. Now for the other
story, which occurred some years afterwards.</p>

<p>One Nathan Agar, for security, hid a stocking-foot
(in which he had wrapped five golden guineas) under
a portion of the thatch. One day, intending to add
another golden one to his store, he found the stocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>-foot,
guineas and all, had vanished. Nathan said nothing
to any one, but just went straight to Wrightson.
‘Thoo’ll knaw what Ah’ve cum’d aboot,’ said Nathan.
Wrightson at once twitted the old man, touching
some previous conversation they had held as to the
advisability of Nathan, who was about sixty years
of age, marrying a girl not quite nineteen. But the
combined wisdom and unhappy future which had
been foretold by Wrightson, had not been sufficient
to overcome the old fool’s idiotic passion for the buxom
lass. In the end he was told to go home, and when
no one was in the house, he had to lift up the flag in
front of the doorstep, and place a certain leaf of the
Bible underneath, and carefully watch who stumbled
over the threshold as they entered. This, Nathan
most carefully carried out. The first who entered
was their young lodger, and he stumbled; after awhile
in came the wife, and she stumbled. I don’t know if
the flag tilted, or whether the next person would have
stumbled also, because Nathan didn’t wait to test
the result of a third entry, but hurried off to Wrightson,
to whom he made known the result. Wrightson told
him that his property was hidden in a certain part of
a pig-sty, together with an old watch, which up to
that time Nathan had not missed. Other and more
serious charges were made, which for ever destroyed
Nathan’s hope of future happiness. Wrightson’s advice
was that he should return home, secure his watch,
give them the five guineas, and send them about
their business. This was promptly carried out, and
I believe is the quickest and cheapest divorce proceeding
on record. One other story has just come into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
my mind, which, if true, proves to what a wonderful
degree he must have possessed a clairvoyant power.</p>

<p>A lady residing in some part of South Durham
was likely to die from a lump in her throat—possibly
a quinsy. Nothing that was done gave her ease;
at last some one suggested the wise man of Stokesley.
A man on horseback was dispatched—I believe the
son of the lady. On approaching Wrightson’s house,
even before he got to the door, the wise man looked
out, saying, as the young man came up, ‘Bait thi
hoss, git summat ti eat, an’ git thisen back agaan;
t’ bleb’s brussen; sha’s all reet now;’ i.e. ‘Bait your
horse, get some refreshment, and return home again;
the lump has burst; she is all right now.’</p>

<p>I have just had the following story given me by
Old Willie Bradley of Great Ayton. His father, who
was a quarryman, had some tools stolen, and, like
every one else in those days, he went to Wrightson.
‘Noo, then,’ said that worthy, on Willie’s father
entering, ’thoo’s cum’d aboot thi teeals, bud Ah can
deea nowt fur tha, ez they’ve been hugg’d accross
watter; bud Ah can let tha see wheear tha’re liggin.’
Wrightson then put him in front of a seeing-glass
(looking-glass) in a darkened room, and told him to
keep looking at the glass, telling him if he took his
eyes off something awful would happen, but my informant
cannot remember what. Anyway, his father
never was so terrified in all his life, and wished he had
never bothered about the lost tools. In a little while,
however, he saw them quite plainly, lying amongst
some bracken in a wood—the place he recognized
quite easily. On telling Wrightson what he had seen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
he was cautioned not to touch them. Wrightson said
he must bring him a live magpie. This he tried to
obtain, but failed; he could not catch one, neither,
for some reason, would any boy who had one part
with his pet; so, after a week, he had to tell the
wise man that the task was impossible. ‘Then,’ said
Wrightson, ‘Ah caan’t wark him onny harm, an’ thoo’ll
‘ ti loss the teeals<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>.’</p>

<p>Other stories of this man’s foreknowledge could be
given almost ad lib. Many of his methods suggested
and adopted were of the heart-frizzling, pin-sticking,
wickenwood, and bottery-tree order. His rites and
ceremonies, too, occasionally savoured of the time in
which he lived; and, after all, there is not much to
wonder at.</p>

<p>We are most of us very much influenced by the
environments of our own day; and after seeing a few
of my own sex in Town, I can forgive Wrightson
much. Like many another clever man, he played to
suit his audience, and sang the songs of the day.
There was, if all is true, no need that he should have
done so, and possibly he knew it—who knows?</p>

<p>Nanny Pearson was held in great fear by the good
people of Goathland, and that, too, a good way into
the present century. As a witch of the old school,
Nanny’s fame was not confined to that locality. Many
stories are still told of her and her doings, two of
which I will give, as they afford a bit of new
information, i.e. the power which holy water had over
witches. I believe in her younger days she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
a communicant of the Roman Catholic faith; be that
as it may, she was neither better nor worse than her
sister witches of any other faith, or no faith at all.
It seems that a Mrs. Webster had a goose, which, as
was the custom of the time, was sitting on a cletch of
eggs near the fireside. Now, Nanny came daily to
Mrs. Webster’s for milk, bringing an empty jug, which
she left, taking a full one away with her. The goose
was set one morning, and remained dutifully on her
nest until evening; but as Nanny approached the
house, off flew the goose in a great state of agitation,
breaking two eggs, and could not be pacified until
Nanny was well off the premises. The same thing
occurred each time Nanny came for her milk, until
some one, who was going to Scarborough, called upon
the wise man and asked his advice. He told them to
get a little holy water, put it in the jug with Nanny’s
milk, and her power would be broken—I suppose that
meant her power over the goose, for she worked a
vast deal of ill after that. This was done; the jug with
the holy water and milk in due course was handed
to Nanny, and just as she took hold of it, the goose
plucked up courage and flew at her, knocking it
out of her hand. It was broken in the fall, the
contents splashing over her feet and gown; with
a shriek she fled, and from that day the goose was
never disturbed again.</p>

<p>Years ago, the Squire of Goathland had a very
beautiful daughter. Some old chap with any amount
of money, and quite ugly, wished to wed her, and
for some unknown reason the Squire favoured his
suit; but, as is often the case, the damsel had given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
her heart to a young farmer in the neighbourhood.
The elder lover got it into his head the couple would
elope, so he sought the aid of Nanny; and the old hag
helped him with a vengeance, inasmuch as she so
sorely afflicted the damsel that she could not rise
from her bed, and her legs began to die—I don’t quite
know what that means; anyway, her limbs became
useless. Her father told her that one of the female
saints was greatly displeased with her obduracy, and
would not restore power to her limbs until she
consented to marry the man of his choice. This she
flatly refused to do, choosing rather to die outright.
The younger lover was distracted; he could not gain
any reliable information, and a personal interview
was impossible. So he did as every one else did
in those days—he paid a visit to the wise man of
Scarborough. The wise man, after a considerable
performance of his own, placed a seeing-glass in front
of the young fellow, desiring him to gaze steadily
thereon, and to tell him if he saw the likeness of
any one appear. Presently the young chap swore
he had seen the face of Nanny Pearson. The wise
man, on hearing this, declared that she was the
origin of all the evil, and told him to return home,
procure by some means a drop of Nanny’s blood,
and steal a few drops of holy water; these had to be
mixed in a cup of milk drawn from a red cow,
and rubbed by him on the soles and calves of his
lady-love, when all would be well. This was a
strongish order, and well-nigh staggered the young
chap. Firstly, how was he to procure a drop of
Nanny’s blood? Stealing the holy water was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
simple affair, as also was the red cow’s milk; but
how to gain admission to his lady-love’s chamber,
and apply the remedies when obtained, was not only
a task of difficulty, but of danger. Bear in mind this
was in the days of dogs and horsewhips, which were
often freely used; but then, as now, love laughs at
difficulties. Once let him become possessed of a drop
of Nanny’s blood, and he would overcome all the
other obstacles. On making his trouble known to
an old dame in the village, one Janet Haswell, she
told him something he already knew in part, i.e.
that in a certain field a hare nightly sat, which
neither dog could catch nor man shoot; this hare,
declared the old lady, was none other than Nanny
herself. She further assured him that if he melted
some silver and made shot of it, he would be able
to hit the hare, and perhaps he might find some
blades of grass stained with blood. Most carefully
the young fellow carried out the old dame’s advice.
He was successful; he hit the hare, and found several
blades of grass spotted with blood, which he carefully
gathered. Next day Nanny was confined to bed,
and for some weeks after. At the time, he alone knew
the cause. Having procured a ladder, he invaded
his love’s room, and applied the remedy, when she recovered
instantly; he then retired. The damsel, rising
and dressing herself, descended the ladder, and was
conveyed to a place of safety, where she remained
until they were wedded. This, by-the-way, I believe
is the first recorded case of massage.</p>

<p>A curious belief still clings to Gribdale Gate.
Any one who dares to stand near the said gate on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
New Year’s Eve, will see an old man open it, pass
through, and then vanish. This takes place just as
the new year is born. There is one man still living
in Great Ayton who has seen the old chap thus
herald in the new year. Again, old people of Great
Ayton still aver that on a certain night a once noted
witch, Nanny Howe, may be seen riding astride on
a broomstick over Howe Wood just at midnight.
This witch, so mounted, is said once to have chased
the devil for miles—on this occasion the two must
have fallen out; perhaps at that time honest folk got
their due. Howe Wood is near Kildale.</p>

<p>Ailer Wood, her real name being Alice, was a
witch of considerable note throughout the Bilsdale
district fifty years ago. In the form of a cat or hare,
she seems to have cared little either what kind or
colour the hounds were which chased her. She never
was caught, but then she had a little way of making
herself invisible when too hard pressed; but in this
she was not alone, a case in point having already
being mentioned. Innumerable times was she fired
at, ‘bud nivver nobody could hit her.’ On one occasion
a damsel named Annie Wilson felt sure the old
thing had bewitched her sweetheart. The reason for
such a supposition lay in the fact that the young
fellow had transferred his affections to some other
fair charmer. My idea is that the other girl had
bewitched him; that, however, was not Annie’s notion.
She, like many another maiden of her time, went
with the sorrow of her aching heart to the wise
man of those parts, one Henry Wilson, who, after
carefully listening to Annie’s woeful story, told her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
how she could discover if it was the witch who had
cast a spell on her lover. She was to return home,
turn the cricket<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> wrong side uppermost, pushing
pretty close together and very securely into the
wood nine pins, saying, as she pushed in the last
one, ‘There’s nine for him and her and the witch’;
in another place she had to push in another nine,
repeating at the ninth, ‘There’s nine for the witch and
her and him’; and lastly, in another place, another
nine, concluding at the ninth by saying, ‘And there
is nine more for all three of them, wi’ her in t’ middle.’
By this arrangement, the vile creature who had stolen
her lover, was always mentioned so that she occupied
a place nearest the witch. All this having been accomplished,
the stool had to be set on its feet, and, under
some pretext or other, Ailer was to be induced to
seat herself thereon. On doing so, she would be
unable to get up again until she truly answered any
questions Annie asked her. Everything was carried
out as ordered by Wilson: Ailer was called in, and
offered a cup of tea, the stool having been pushed
toward her; she was invited to seat herself, and
have her bite and sup comfortably. Now, was ever
a maiden nearer finding out just why her lover had
deserted her? The stool was even put in front of the
fire, and Ailer again invited to seat herself; but no,
the witch quietly replied, it would not be possible for
her to enjoy the good things they had given her, seated
on the back of a ‘pricky-back otch’n<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>.’ Ailer by some
means had found out what had been done, and so
escaped the charm which had been prepared for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>No doubt exists in the minds of many people now,
that hedgehogs milk the cows<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>. It seems they creep
up to them whilst they are resting, and draw their
milk from them. My old friend told me they always
killed a hedgehog whenever they saw one, for that
reason.</p>

<p>One Nancy Newgill, a Broughton witch, used to
set hedgehogs to milk the cows of those she had
a spite against, and it was commonly believed that
at times she used to turn herself into one, and then
‘neeabody’s coos had onny chance’; anyway, there was
one hedgehog which could run as fast as a hare, and
never was catched, ‘ner killed ner nowt.’ This Nancy
Newgill cast a spell on a certain Martha Brittain,
from which she could obtain no ease, no matter what
she took; so off to the wise man<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Martha went. She
was told to go to Stokesley, and buy a new fire-shovel,
upon which she had to chalk Nancy’s name<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>; then to
make a cake—the ingredients need not be given—and,
after closing her doors and window, the cake was
to be baked upon the shovel resting on the fire.
This was done at four o’clock in the afternoon<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>. Now,
at the time this cake was being baked, Nancy Newgill
was ’luking’ weeds in a field a mile away, and standing
quite close to her was my informant, Mrs. Peary.
Suddenly Nancy clapped her hand on her stomach,
crying out, ‘Ah mun gan yam! Ah mun gan yam!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>’
She left the field, and was ill for days after; but
Martha Brittain began to mend straight away, and
was as right as ever she could be.</p>

<p>This, however, is a small affair, compared with the
case of a man who lived at Broughton, and had
a spell cast on him, by whom he did not know; at
least, he was divided in his doubts. He suspected
first Nancy, and also a man with an evil eye at
Nunthorpe, but he could not really say which of
them had cast the spell; so he went to the wise
man, but in this he got little comfort. The wise man
told him, before he could do anything he must be
quite certain who had cast the spell, because if he
worked a counter-charm on any one, and they were
innocent, what he did would fall upon the complainant,
in addition to what he was already suffering. He
advised him to ‘plump<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>’ both Nancy and the
Nunthorpe man with it. On accusing Nancy, she
was so indignant, and looked him so straight in the
face, and swore such a fearful oath, that he felt certain
she for once was innocent; in such contrast was the
behaviour of the evil-eyed one of Nunthorpe, that he
was equally satisfied that he was the man. So sure was
he, that he told the wise man he would chance it; so
they set to work. A fire of wickenwood having been
lighted close on midnight, a ball of clay was beaten flat
with the back of an old Bible; on this a rude figure
was scooped out in the shape of a man. Into this
rough mould was poured a mixture of pitch, beeswax,
hog’s lard, bullock’s blood, and a small portion of
the fat from a bullock’s heart. The whole having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
been melted and well stirred on the wickenwood
fire, what remained of the mixture after filling the
mould was divided; one-half was thrown into water,
worked into a ball, and thrown away; the remaining
portion was poured on to the fire, causing a most
tremendous blaze; when this died out, the ashes were
buried in the churchyard. The figure having been
removed from its mould, and two small holes made
to represent the eyes, a pin was thrust into one of
these eyes, an incantation pronounced, and the spell
was concluded. The pain left the man as he was
returning home, and that very night the evil-eyed
Nunthorpian was seized with a fearful pain, and
before morning was blind of an eye—the eye corresponding
to the one through which the pin had been
thrust in the wax figure. I had the above from
one who well knew the trio. My informant is still
living.</p>

<p>Matthew Appleton, of Busby, for many years
ruled the planets—it seems he ruled them so well
that he found a pot of gold. This was ruling
the planets to some purpose, and it is a great pity
astronomers don’t work this seemingly dead science
up a bit.</p>

<p>In connexion with the witch-lore of the riding,
it strikes one as singular, that whilst many of the
stories told of local witches closely resemble those
of other countries, yet other stories, equally common,
both abroad and a little further north, so far as I
have investigated, are with us conspicuous by their
absence. Of witches turning their victims into horses
by throwing a bridle over their heads and riding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
them the night through, or of a witch having
been outwitted and treated in like manner, even in
some instances casting a shoe, and of being reshod
during the night, the shoe remaining nailed to the
hand on regaining their natural form—of such
stories, I repeat, not a vestige remains amongst us.
Thorpe’s <cite>Mythology</cite> and the Wilkie MS. give many
instances; and though some of the stories are dated
almost in recent times, doubtless their radicals are to
be found in the myth of times remote.</p>

<p>Again, whilst we retain the belief in the efficacy
of the dead hand in the curing of certain diseases, one
never hears mention of the ‘hand of glory<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>.’ There
are old people to-day who tell you of its marvellous
power, but their knowledge is that gained from hearsay.
I have never met a single person who knew of an
instance of its having been used in the North Riding;
and if ever such was the case, it must have been long
ago, for many of the old folk know absolutely nothing
about it.</p>

<p>Silver shot was a deadly charge, because, in some
way not explained, it was charmed. Jane Wood, who
was accounted a witch about seventy years ago in the
Basedale district, gave little heed either to dogs or
guns; when she assumed the form of a hare, she
escaped from the former quite easily, and the latter
never could hit her. At last one sportsman, acting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
on the advice of a wise man, melted some silver
coins in an iron ladle smeared with the blood of
a hare. This was done at the blacksmith’s forge, the
same being plentifully supplied with wickenwood.
The melted silver was poured into a basin of water,
which divided it into fine particles; suitable pieces
were collected, the gun charged, and next evening
the venturesome hare was fired at. Though it escaped,
it was evidently badly hit. Suspicion had for some
time rested on Jane. Her cottage was visited; she
declared she was too ill to rise and open the door,
having, as she said, accidentally turned a beehive
over and got severely stung. This statement did
not satisfy those outside. The door was burst open,
and Jane pulled out of bed; over one part of her
body she was found to be covered with small sores,
which there was no doubt had been caused by the
silver shot. Anyway, that venturesome hare was
never seen again, so no further proof was required.</p>

<p>There is one point which requires a few words of
explanation, at least so far as it can be explained.
We have heard of witches who allowed themselves
to be chased as hares, some of which, if not caught,
were bitten just as they were entering their own
homes; on examination, teeth-marks were found on
a corresponding part of their body. The same may
be said of the injuries inflicted by the silver shot.
The telling of these stories leaves no doubt in one’s
mind that the witches in the cases mentioned are
supposed to have turned themselves into hares. This,
however, was not always the case, as the following
story will show. There was a woman on whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
grave suspicion rested; for some reason or other
she was never openly charged with being a witch,
but old heads were ominously shaken when her
name was mentioned. In the district in which she
lived, there was a notorious hare, which simply jeered
at dogs and guns alike. At length some one suggested
silver shot; this was duly made, and the hare shot
dead. Afterwards, on comparing the times, it was found
that Mrs.—— had thrown up her arms the very
moment when the hare was shot, ejaculating, ‘They
have killed my familiar spirit’; uttering these words,
she fell dead on her kitchen floor. Now Mrs.—— had
not been out that day—there were plenty of witnesses
to testify that—so it would seem it was not always
a case of transformation, but a familiar spirit which
was chased, whilst the individual herself was at home
attending to her household duties. Of course all
such were subject to the ills which might befall
their familiars.</p>

<p>There seems to be a very close connexion between
a hare being shot and corresponding wounds being
found on the person of those who had so transformed
themselves, and the stories told of the witch mares
being shod and the shoes remaining fixed to their
hands when their original form was resumed.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Hobmen.</i></p>

<p>At one time the family of Oughtred, who lived
on a farm near Hob Hill, Upleatham, were greatly
assisted in their various occupations by the hobman,
who lived in the Hob Hill. These hobmen are heard
of now and again in the North Riding. The hob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>man<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
with us seems to hold the same place as the
brownies of the north, and the pixies of Devonshire.
Anyway, the hobman still did his work as recently
as 1820; for the Oughtreds had their hay turned,
their cattle brought home and driven back again,
their corn and other grain winnowed, their turnips
topped and tailed, and I do not know what all. What
they did to offend the hobman, is not known. But
it is thought that a man hung his coat on the winnowing
machine, and forgot to remove it when his
day’s work was done. The hobman possibly thought,
when he entered late at night, that it had been left
for him; and no offence, it seems, could be greater
than to offer a hobman clothes of any kind, so he
went away, and has never been heard of since. It
seems at the very time they unfortunately displeased
their friend the hobman, they also incurred the ill-will
of Peggy Flaunders; for about this time, late one
evening, a fearful knocking came at the back door.
The maid, on opening it, saw a fearful thing like
a blazing pig standing on the step; with one wild
shriek she fled, crying out to her master and mistress
that the devil had come, and was standing on the back
doorstep. They at once asked, had she closed the
back door? On being told that she was too frightened
to do anything else but flee from such a monster,
they both sank back in dismay, well knowing the
evil spirit had been given a chance to enter, which
they rightly feared it would not fail to avail itself of.
They rushed to the back door, but nothing was there;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
still they had their misgivings—they were terribly
apprehensive. And sure enough it turned out not
without cause—crockery was smashed, machinery was
broken, cattle died; in fact things got into such a parlous
state, that they decided to leave. On the day
when they were preparing to flit, a friend looked in,
and asked Oughtred if he really meant shifting. As
he asked the question, a queer little head popped out
over the top of the press, and a voice squeaked out,
‘Aye, we’re gahin ti flit ti morn’; on hearing which,
Oughtred said, ‘Whya, if thoo’s gahin wiv uz, it’s teea
neea ewse gahin; wa mud ez weel stop<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>.’ The wise
man was eventually consulted. Legend sayeth not
where he lived; but under his directions a live black
cock bird was pierced with pins, and roasted alive
at dead of night, with every door, window, and cranny
and crevice stuffed up. By these means Peggy’s power
and the imp were overcome.</p>

<p>Years ago, when the old church at Marske-by-the-Sea
was condemned, and a new one about to be built,
it was decided to pull down the old structure and use
the stone for building the new. This bit of vandalism
was duly commenced; part of the old building was
razed, and the stone carted to the new site<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>—so
far, so good. The old people murmured, for they
objected greatly to the demolition of the edifice in
which they and their fore-elders had worshipped;
but they were powerless—they could only stand by
and watch with aching hearts stone after stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
being carted away. And so the first day’s work came
to an end, which to them was work of desecration,
and they returned home sad at heart. But if they
were powerless, they had a champion, and one whom
they had never dreamt of taking up their cause.
Next morning, when the men returned to their work,
what was their surprise, and the amazement of every
one else, to find the old church whole again, without
a stone displaced or a mark of the previous day’s work
to be found anywhere. Every stone had been brought
back again and replaced <i lang="la">in situ</i>, and the mortar which
had been used to reset the displaced stones was as
hard and set as that of hundreds of years before.</p>

<p>This marvellous occurrence was duly reported at
head-quarters. What the officials thought or imagined,
is not recorded; they ordered the work to proceed,
and even set on more men to pull the old place down,
so that on the second day a considerable portion was
carted away and stacked on the new site; but next
morning the old church was found to have been fully
repaired during the night, every stone having once
again been brought back and placed in its original
position. Things were now looking a bit serious. On
the third day, however, work was resumed, a portion
again pulled down and carted away, but this time
men were set to watch the stones and find out who
came for them. Now, whether these watchers fell
asleep—they declared they did not—or whether in
the darkness the stones were all stolen away so quietly
that they never heard or saw anything of what was
transpiring, cannot be stated; one thing is only known—when
daylight appeared, every stone had vanished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
and again the old church was found to have been
restored, so perfectly that no one could tell that ever
a stone had been removed. Those in authority were
bound to admit that it was useless to contend further
against such a powerful and invisible opponent. For
long it was not generally known by what means the
work of replacement had been wrought; but there
were those who knew, and in time every one did.
It was the hobman, assisted by others of his friends.
In those days it was simply the essence of folly for
architects and bricklayers to pit themselves against
a hobman, just the same it would be to-day,
if the hobmen took it into their heads to undertake
a job—but they don’t now.</p>

<p>There was a hobman once had his home in a hill
near to Hob Garth, and no doubt in his day performed
many acts which are now forgotten; however, I had
one related to me years ago by an old chap who at
that time was working on the Mulgrave estate. His
grandfather, Thomas Stonehouse, lived at Hob Garth
for many years. I think he had a small holding; anyway,
he kept sheep. It seems that some misunderstanding
arose between him and one Matthew Bland, of Great
Fryup. Bland was of a vindictive nature—at least, if
the supposition was true that he broke Tommy’s
hedge down late one night, drove the sheep out, and
left them to wander whither they liked. And wander
they did to some purpose, for at the close of the
day following, Stonehouse had only managed to find
five out of forty. Next morning, what was his surprise
not only to find his sheep back in the field, but
the hedge repaired with new posts and rails. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
neighbours knew that he could not have done the
repairing, for he had caught a severe cold, having been
wet to the skin searching for the lost sheep the day
previous. Next night, however, every head of cattle
belonging to Bland was turned loose. ‘And great deed
there was lating on ’em; it war ower a fo’tnit afoor they
war all gitten tigither again.’ That Stonehouse was
quite innocent of this bit of retaliation was clear even
to Bland, as it was well known he was too ill to stir
out of doors. But when Bland had recovered all his
lost cattle, Stonehouse’s were set loose again, and
the damage done was even greater this time; and
as the poor fellow was still too ill to turn out to find
them, the neighbours did what they could. This
time, however, even fewer were found, but again on
the following morning all but four were safely back in
the field, and all damage repaired; subsequently the
four were found dead, having fallen into a disused
quarry. People talked, as naturally they would, and
the bringing back of the lost sheep and repairing of
the rails was put down to the hobman. When this
conclusion was come to, heads were shaken in an
ominous manner, for evidently if Tommy was befriended
by the hobman, Matthew would have to mind
what he did. As soon as Tommy could, he set off to
see his sheep. It happened to be rather late when
he paid the first visit after his illness, owing to
the fact that a neighbour was driving past where the
sheep were, and as he was returning presently, he
offered to put Stonehouse down and pick him up again
as he returned. Tommy counted his sheep, and after
cutting some hay for them—it was wintertime—he sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
by the gate waiting for the return of his neighbour.
Presently an old man accosted him, and begged him not
to fret about the lost sheep, as they would be more
than compensated for when lambing time came. The
old chap told him that Bland had on both occasions
been guilty, but that he had not to mind. Just
then his friend drove up. Tommy bade his new
acquaintance good-night, thanked him, and got
into the cart. No sooner was he seated, than
the good neighbour asked him what he meant by
saying good-night and thanking nobody at all. It
transpired that the owner of the cart had not noticed
any one speaking to Tommy. In the end he thought
the old chap ’war a bit waak an rafflin.’ Anyway,
when lambing time came, though the weather was very
severe, and every one else, and more particularly Bland,
lost many lambs, Stonehouse never lost one. Ewes,
during Tommy’s absence, were found safely delivered
of their lambs, and mostly had two, and never a black
one amongst them. ‘An’ noo that war a larl bit sing’lar,
warn’t it? Bud then, ya knaw, i’ them daays when
t’ hobman did tak ti yan, ya war yal reet i’ t’ lang-run;
an’ ivvery wo’d ’at Ah’ve tell’d ya’s trew, ’coz
Ah’ve heeard mah gran’father tell t’ taal ower an’
up agaan; bud it’s a gay bit sen noo,’ wound up
my informant. The hobman was described as a little
old fellow, with very long hair, large feet, eyes,
mouth, and hands, stooping much as he walked, and
carrying a long holly stick. The date of the story
would be about 1760.</p>

<small>SOME CHARACTERISTIC YORKSHIRE SAYINGS</small></h2>

<div class="sml">

<p>Kindly contributed by the Rev. <span class="smcap">M. C. F. Morris</span>, B.C.L., M.A.,
Author of <cite>Yorkshire Folk-Talk</cite>.</p></div>


<p>There is a saying current among us in the East
Riding that ‘it takes a Yorkshireman to talk Yorkshire’;
the very form of the expression smacks of
the county; and if this be true, as true it is, of the
mere pronunciation of the dialect, it is no less true
with regard to those other linguistic features—the
idioms, phraseology, and way of putting things, which
in this, as in every other folk-speech, go to a great
extent to make up the vernacular. We might even
advance a step beyond the statement just quoted,
for by no means the majority even of those who
have lived in the county all their lives can tongue
the speech aright, and many not at all. It is far
from uncommon to hear an accurate pronunciation
of the dialect from the lips of those who are supposed
to speak it well, and to find at the same time
that the speaker wholly lacks an appreciation of
those modes of thought, those turns and peculiarities
of expression in which the Yorkshire dialect is
peculiarly rich, and without which it sounds by
comparison only tame and feeble. As between dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>Latin
and the well-turned and polished, though often
long-winded, sentences of Cicero, so is it in some sort
between the two styles of dialectical Yorkshire to
which I refer. The one grates upon the ear, while
the other rings true. Over and above idiomatic
usages strictly so called, there are many sayings
more or less familiar which, though they cannot be
brought under any rules of speech, like those of
grammar, yet seem to possess a certain raciness all
their own, and at the same time bring before us
something of the Yorkshireman’s force and character.
To some of these I will here direct attention, though
it must be understood that what are here cited are
but a few disconnected specimens of many more which
might be given.</p>

<p>We are most of us, no doubt, aware that in all his
dealings and matters of business the Yorkshireman is
pre-eminently of a strongly practical turn of mind.
We ‘reckon nowt’ of a man who is not that.</p>

<p>It would be untrue to say that sentiment is a state
of mind absolutely unknown to his nature; but its
presence is so rare, and its hold upon him so feeble,
that it need hardly be taken into account in considering
his character. There may, no doubt, be times
when such feelings are brought into play, but the
strange thing is that when we might most reasonably
look for them, we look in vain.</p>

<p>Those attractive personal charms of the gentler
sex which with ordinary mortals are generally supposed
to have their effect at times when a young
man is seeking a partner for life, weigh but little
for the most part with the matter-of-fact Yorkshire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>man
who regards his intended from a severely
practical point of view. What, we may ask, would
the sentimentalist of the highly strung poetical
temperament think of this piece of advice which
was once given to a youth at an interesting period
of his life? ‘Leeak at a lass’s han’s when thoo’s
laatin’ a weyfe; deean’t be daffled wiv ’er feeace!’
It was said in the olden days that the lass who
churned ‘wi’ buckles on her shoon’ was to be lightly
esteemed, but for sheer practicality the manual test
could hardly be surpassed. I well remember, many
years ago, the case of a man who was twice married.
His first wife proved herself an excellent one in every
way, and the couple lived happily together. When
she died, and he proceeded to look out for a successor,
his choice fell on one who also turned out a no less
industrious and tidy woman, though her personal
attractiveness was not of a specially pronounced
character. On being asked by a neighbour what
led him to make his selection in the way he did, he
made answer to the effect that his sole reason for
doing so was because his second wife’s ’carcase’
reminded him so strongly of that of his first; she
was a lithe, active woman, and he thought, no doubt,
that she looked like work.</p>

<p>Despite these purely utilitarian considerations in
matters matrimonial, the saying we have heard that
the ‘sweetness of a posy mainly hings on fra wheear
yan gits it,’ indicates that some at least of our country-folk,
under certain favouring conditions, can say pretty
things, though it must be confessed such elegancies
are few and far between. The ordinary village gossip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
who neglects her household duties for the sake of
‘having a crack’ with her neighbours, has from ‘prehistoric
times,’ no doubt, come in for much plain-speaking,
of which this may be given as an example:
‘T’ weyfe ’at can ho’d her au’d man up wi’ t’ news
oot o’ t’ toon, meeastlins bakes bo’nt breead.’ Such
wives as these are not the ones to pay much heed
to principles of domestic economy. Nevertheless,
considerations of this kind are as a rule carefully
thought out by our country-folk, if not scientifically,
at least in a way that makes a shilling go as far as
possible. It may be said, indeed, speaking generally,
that domestic affairs receive, on the part of the Yorkshire
wife, an amount of attention that is highly
commendable, and adds not a little to the happiness
of the family, and in no part of England do the
people understand the meaning of the word ‘comfort’
better than they do in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Cleanliness is a virtue for which our people have
long been conspicuous, though even here extremes
will sometimes meet, and excessive scrupulousness
in this respect will at times be something of a burden
to the household rather than a joy.</p>

<p>It was once said of a ‘gudewife’ whose washings,
scrubbings, polishings, and brushings were performed
with more than ordinary frequency and vigour, ‘Sha
scrats an’ tews fra morn whahl neet; sha werrits an’
natters an’ grummels t’ daay lang.... There’s neea
comfort i’ t’ hoos; an’ ther nivver is wheear t’ kettle’s
breet all ower.’</p>

<p>In days gone by it used to be said that a ’calling’
wife and a dusty spinning-wheel were commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
associated together, and the saying, ‘A mucky moos-trap
shoots’ (shouts) ‘for t’ cat,’ was one of those standing
rebukes to a slatternly <i lang="la">mater familias</i> which is
tellingly put, while the following doggerel might
well find a place on the walls of every kitchen:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">A cobweb i’ t’ kitchen</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ feeat-marks on t’ step</div>
  <div class="verse">Finnd neea wood i’ t’ yewn</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ neea cooals i’ t’ skep.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>No theme is more frequently harped upon by our
old folks, when contrasting present manners and
customs with those of a generation or two ago, than
the change that has come over the community in
the matter of dress, and there is a moral which
they commonly draw therefrom. ‘There’s sadly
owermich prahd noo,’ say they; while the money
that many of the young people spend upon their
dress passes the understanding of their elders,
who in their younger days were content with
fustian jackets and print gowns. It was said, for
instance, by one who held that a hood was a suitable
head-covering for a woman, that ‘she is a feeal ’at
hugs a geease’ (i.e. the price of a goose) ‘on t’ top
of her heead.’ In consequence of extravagancies of
this nature, it is doubtful if, in spite of increased
wages and cheapness of living, our farm lads and
lasses save as much money as they did in the olden
days. With corn at the high price it was, say, fifty
years ago, the people were early inured to thrifty
ways, and the absolute necessity for carefulness in all
things was frequently insisted upon. Thus, for instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
a child would be told that ‘a beean thrawn away at
t’ fore-end is a dinner lost at t’ back-end.’ Few of
those living now would credit with what hard fare
their grandfathers had often to be content, and yet
the physique of the men which those times produced
was probably not inferior, in point of endurance and
capacity for work, to that at the present time.</p>

<p>Most of us, I dare say, remember the schoolgirl’s
reply when asked to define scandal, namely, ‘When
no one does nothing to nobody, and some one else
goes and tells’; and although we cannot perhaps
surpass even in Yorkshire that happy explanation
of the term, yet we do own to certain sayings with
reference to the unruly member, some of which may
not be unworthy of being placed on record. There
is one, for instance, which savours somewhat of the
schoolgirl’s definition just mentioned, and there are
probably many similar ones; it runs thus: ‘Them
’at says they deean’t leyke saayin’ nowt aboot nowt
ti neeabody, meeastlins pass tahm by saayin’ summat
aboot summat ti somebody.’</p>

<p>Again, the following rhyme aptly hits off what,
it is to be feared, is a not altogether uncommon
failing in Yorkshire as elsewhere:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Them ’at says they weean’t, an’ diz it still,</div>
  <div class="verse">Dizn’t deea it when they saay they will.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We all know what to expect from a ‘slaap un’; he
or she can never be depended on for anything. It
was said of a female whose tongue could not be
trusted, or, as we say in the East Riding, whom
we could not ‘talk after’: ‘Ah reckon nowt <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>o’
what sha says.... Praise frev a slaap tongue is nae
better wo’th ’an rain i’ haay tahm.’</p>

<p>That the idler is ever ready to make excuses for
his idleness, and that half the ‘loafers’ who infest
the countryside are as capable of doing a day’s work
as any one else in the community, we are well aware.
We know, too, how any slight ailment is by many
used as a plea for having an ‘off-day’; it is to such
‘ne’er-do-weels’ as these that the saying applies:
‘Yan’s nivver ower waak to wark when yan’s yabble
ti bunch an au’d hat ower t’ green.’</p>

<p>It is remarkable how few of the well-known English
proverbs are in common use among our country
folk in the form in which they have been handed
down to us. They are for the most part either supplanted
by corresponding ones of more or less local
growth or by extemporized expressions which do
duty for the same and are of scarcely less force.
Thus, for example, it was said of one who had been
addicted to intemperate habits, and had at length
given them up, but, alas! only to fall immediately
into the wily snares of horse-racing and betting:
‘Ah deean’t think ’at he’s mended hissen mich:
they saay ’at he’s signed t’ pledge, bud started ti
hoss-race; t’ rabbit dizn’t fare na betther ’at ’scapes
fra t’ fox an’ meets wi’ t’ rezzil.’</p>

<p>The well-worn saying that ‘prevention is better
than cure,’ is one which none of us will care to
gainsay, and we are for the most part minded so
to word the truism; the ancient statement is, however,
apt to take a different turn when uttered by
Yorkshire lips. On one occasion a Yorkshireman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
remarked to another countryman, with reference to
a certain fire in a house in the neighbourhood,
‘He sleck’d t’ fire oot afoor mich damage wer deean’;
whereto the reply came, ‘’T may be clivver ti stop
a bull, bud it’s wiser ti loup t’ yat.’</p>

<p>An instance is recorded, and we fear it is by no
means a solitary one, of a certain would-be fine lady
in one of our Yorkshire villages who dressed herself
up in a manner singularly unbecoming for one in
her station in life, and withal gave herself highly
ridiculous airs. This kind of parade, as may be
supposed, gave no little offence in certain quarters,
while others of her sex, though not able or willing
to adorn their persons to the same absurd degree
of finery, were in no wise inferior in real worth to
this flaunty and gaily bedecked female. As ‘my
lady’ sailed down the ‘town street’ on one occasion,
a critical observer of her ways was heard to remark,
‘Sha gans wiv her heead up as thoff yan wer nowt
bud muck; bud Ah’ll tell ya what, Ah’s as good
as sha is, if Ah’s nut sa weel putten on—black fleeace
or white fleeace, t’ mutton’s t’ seeam.’ It would
be difficult to say whether such a one were the
more deserving of all the severe things that were
heaped upon her or another of whom we have heard—Bessie
by name. Her ‘pleeanin’’ ways were thus
described: ‘It’s awlus ower fine or ower wet for
oor Bessie, bud sum folks is that grum’ly, that they
awlus ’ev a steean i’ ther shoon.’</p>

<p>The ordinary infirmities of the flesh are no doubt
the inheritance of the Yorkshireman equally with the
rest of mankind; we can claim for him no immunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
from these. He is ‘hurt with the same weapons,
subject to the same diseases, healed by the same
means,’ even as others. Fools are perhaps rather
less frequently met with in this than in some other
counties, and if there is one bump more clearly
developed upon the Yorkshireman’s cranium than
another, it is that of caution. Those who happen
to be deficient in that particular quality come in
for no unfrequent reproofs and warnings from their
more ‘gaumish’ fellows. Thus to one who was always
being taken in by people of whom he knew nothing,
this piece of advice was given: ‘Afoor yan claps
a stthrange dog uppo t’ heead, yan s’u’d awlus leeak
’at it teeal;’ while of another, whose propensity to
spend money was in excess of that usually found
among those who dwell between the Humber and
the Tees, it was said, ‘Aw deear, what a feeal he’s
been! bud Ah’ve telled him mair ’an yance ’at money
ta’en oot o’ t’ pocket’s mair ’an hauf spent.’ Again,
we have a Yorkshireman’s equivalent of the brief
injunction, ‘look before you leap,’ expressed as follows:
‘Nivver loup a stell widoot ya knaw what sooart of
a footho’d you’ll leet on.’</p>

<p>To the same effect as the foregoing is a small bit
of admonition that comes down to us from the days
of the old tinder-box; and for lack of its due observance,
many a small trouble has been experienced.
The word of warning shapes itself thus: ‘Afoor yan
flints tundther, knaw wheear t’ rush-leet is.’ A few old
formulas of this kind may even still occasionally be
heard. It was not long ago that I was told of one
from the borders of Durham and Yorkshire which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
struck me as having an antiquated flavour, but yet,
withal, one of a picturesque kind. The reason for
its use was to reprove a child for displaying a certain
greediness at table. It would sound strangely in
modern ears to hear it said to a child in such a case:
‘Thoo’s ’greed wi’ sham an’ gi’en mense a grot’
(you have made an agreement with shame, and given
decent behaviour a groat).</p>

<p>There is no little truth as well as force in the old
expression which says, ‘Them ’at crack o’ thersens
awlus to’n’ (turn) ‘oot blawn eggs’; and those who
have risen in the world, especially if it be by questionable
means, may well take a lesson from the saying,
‘Him ’at’s gitten ti t’ top o’ t’ stee, dhrops farest
when he falls.’</p>

<p>In Yorkshire, as elsewhere, those who thus ‘crack o’
thersens,’ besides being unpopular with their fellows,
are, generally speaking, more easily daunted than those
who are not given to blow their own trumpets.</p>

<p>That was a truly good specimen of our dialectical
usages which had reference to one who was in the
habit of sounding his own praises in no measured
terms. ‘Whya,’ said a countryman, who took a fairly
accurate measure of this vain boaster’s ways, ‘Ah
deean’t knaw; he’ll mebbe nut deea sa mich when
all cums ti all; Ah’ve heeard folk saay ’at a bragger
taks a lang stthrahd when t’ teeap’ (the ram) ‘grunds
it heeaf’ (stamps the ground with its hoof).</p>

<p>The most trifling and homely incidents frequently
give occasion to a Yorkshireman for bringing out
some of his flashes of wit and raciness of expression.
I remember not long ago hearing of a native of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
North Riding who, one day in the fore-part of ‘sheep-clipping
time,’ accompanied an old shepherd in order
to have some sheep washed. They had to wait near
the appointed place until another flock had gone
through the well-known process of cleansing, and
as they were whiling away the time, the vicar’s
mother and sister drove by. Seeing what was going
on, they pulled up and entered into conversation
with the old shepherd, who, like every Yorkshireman,
was a bit of a character. ‘We do so like the smell
of sheep,’ they said; to which the old man replied,
‘Yis, mum, an’ seea deea Ah; bud Ah leykes t’ teeast
on ’em betther!’</p>

<p>In the few examples I have here given, it will
perhaps be seen how that the Yorkshireman has
a way of expressing himself which seems to be
peculiarly his own, and how his utterances generally
strike a stranger by their originality and quaintness.
Refreshing is it to hear these when spoken with all
the naturalness and force with which some of the
older folk tongue them. They come upon us like
whiffs of sea air laden with ozone, which put new life
into us and make us walk with a lighter step.</p>

<p>I will bring my short chapter to a close by a
characteristic little story which forcibly illustrates
how strong the Yorkshireman’s ruling passion—I
mean, of course, his love of horseflesh—is in death.</p>

<p>I was told quite recently of a farmer who, at the
time of the transaction to be related, was laid up
with a dangerous illness; indeed, it proved to be his
last. At this time he was possessed of a thoroughbred
mare, which he was anxious to sell. A dealer in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
neighbourhood had had his eye on the mare, and
wanted at once to buy it. Accordingly he called
on the farmer, and was shown into his bedroom.
The bargain was not struck during the visit, though
the difference between the two was only a matter
of a sovereign or so.</p>

<p>A few days, however, after this interview, the dealer
again presented himself at the house, not knowing
that in the meantime the farmer had died. On entering
the yard, the horse-dealer inquired of the man in the
stables, how the master was. ‘Oh! he’s deead,’ said
the man; ‘he deed last Tho’sda, bud afoor he deed he
said ’at thoo was ti ’ev t’ meer!’</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>IDIOMS AND THE PECULIAR USE OF CERTAIN
WORDS</small></h2>


<p>The folk-speech of our county abounds in idioms,
and possesses many forms of curious phraseology.</p>

<p>It is these and other peculiarities which add much
to its forcefulness, and form one of its main features.</p>

<p>It will be the object of this short chapter to explain
some of these usages and idioms.</p>

<p>In writing such a chapter there is one difficulty
presents itself—where to commence. There is too
much material. As a starting-point, let us take the
following remark, which was made to me the other
day by an old dame:—</p>


<ul>
<li class="list">‘Them lads weean’t deea ez tha’re tell’d; Ah may shoot
at ’em ez oft ez Ah leyke, tha deean’t <em>mend ther waays</em>.
Ah wadn’t mahnd if tha war <em>onny bit leyke</em>;’ i.e. ‘Those boys
will not do as they are told; I may shout at <em>’em</em> as often as
I may, they do not mend their ways. I would not mind if
they were any way reasonable.’</li></ul>

<p>One word with reference to ‘’em.’ Writers on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
Yorkshire mark ‘them,’ so written, with an elision
point (’em).</p>

<p>Is this correct? I offer an opinion for what it is
worth. The vocabulary of our people dates back to
a very remote period; the same may be said of many
of the rules which govern their speech. May not this
‘em’ be a case in point; and instead of being a contraction
of ‘them,’ only the plural form ‘hem,’ which
they have retained along with many other old-time
words?</p>

<p>Wicliff, in the parable of the Prodigal Son, translates
as follows:—‘And the younger of hem;’ and
a few lines below, we find, ‘and he departed’ (divided)
‘to hem.’ Although our people have not retained in
their vocabulary the word ‘departed,’ they have
held on to another equally archaic, i.e. parting,
‘partinge,’ to divide. I leave this for others better
able than I to decide.</p>

<p>In the old dame’s statement it was said that the
lads would not mend their ways. ‘To mend our ways’
is equivalent to saying, ‘improve,’ ‘to grow better’;
and to be ‘onny bit leyke’=being reasonable.</p>

<p>In the sentence ‘Yon’s nowt ti mahn,’ the word
‘yon’ signifies ‘that or those over there.’ ‘Yon
chap’ is ‘that man over there’; or ‘yon coos,’ ‘those
cows over there.’ ‘That chap’ points out a man
near at hand; ‘yon chap,’ one who is a greater or
less distance removed from the speakers. Hence,
‘Yon is nothing to mine’ tells that the thing spoken
of was some distance away. ‘To,’ in the statement
‘to mine,’ is equivalent to ‘compared with,’ i.e. ‘That
(one) is nothing when compared with mine.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>‘To’ also=‘for,’ e.g. ‘good ti nowt,’ ‘good for
nothing.’ Again, ‘to’=‘this.’ And although to some
it sounds odd to hear a farmer say, ‘Wa s’all ’ev
a good crop ti year,’ ‘we shall have a good crop to’
(this) ‘year,’ it only sounds peculiar because it is
unfamiliar. The same individual who would smile at
such usage, would perhaps a moment afterwards ask,
‘what have we <em>to</em> dinner <em>to</em>-day?’ i.e. ‘What have we
for dinner this day?’ The usage of the negative in the
double, treble, or quadruple form is not infrequent.
‘Ah nivver at neea tahm sed nowt aboot nowt ti
neeabody neeaways; Ah’d nivver neea call teea,’
literally, reads thus: ‘I never at no time said
nothing about nothing to nobody no way; I had
never no reason to;’ or, ‘I never said a word to any one;
I had no reason to.’ ‘Ah’d nivver neea call teea.’
‘Call’=‘reason.’ ‘Ah’ll gi’e him a good calling when
he cums in; bud he wants his jacket lacing weel t’
maist ov owt.’ ‘To call’ here=‘to scold.’</p>

<p>‘Sha called ma leyke all that; aye! ivverything
’at sha c’u’d lig her tung teea.’ In this instance,
‘called’ means more than a scolding; it means, ‘to
defame,’ ‘to have said of the person shameful things,’
‘to illify<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>,’ ‘to speak evil of.’ ‘To lace any
one’s jacket,’ is ‘to administer a sound thrashing’;
and to say ‘ivverything ’at one can lay the tongue
to,’ is to heap upon a person all the opprobrious
epithets we can remember or invent. We should not
say to a child, ‘What is your name?’ Possibly did we
do so, we should be met with a blank stare of amaze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>ment.
The correct form would be, ‘What do they
call you?’ and you would have an answer at once.</p>

<p>We should not say ‘Shout to John,’ but ‘Call of
John’; or ‘Thoo’ll ’a’e ti shoot on him looder na that,
if thoo aims ti mak him hear,’ i.e. ‘you will have to
shout to him louder than that, if you intend to make
him hear.’ This word ‘call’ caused considerable
bewilderment to one who had to make a complaint
to a mother of her son. Being a stranger, the mother
replied to him in her best English, but although
she managed to divest her speech of much of its
usual vocabulary, idiom and the peculiar use of
certain words were not so easily laid on one side. She
began, ‘It’s ti little ewse, bud Ah’ll call on him, an’
Ah’ll call him well when he cums; bud it’s ti no good
my calling him when he does cum, foor Ah’ve called
him many a tahm afoor.’</p>

<p>Now, why the good lady should promise to call for
him when he had come, and to assure the gentleman
it was of no use calling him when he arrived,
because she had done so many a time before, didn’t
leave things as clear as they might have been. What
she really meant to say was, ‘I will shout for him,
and give him a scolding when he comes; but really
scolding is of little use, as I have done so many
a time before.’</p>

<p>A little way back the word ‘aim’ was used—‘if
thoo aims ti mak him hear.’</p>

<p>‘Aim’=‘to intend,’ ‘to hope,’ ‘to think,’ ‘to go.’</p>

<ul><li class="list">‘Ah aim ti git deean ti-day’=I intend to get done to-day;
or, I hope to get done to-day.</li>

<li class="list">‘Ah aim ’at sha’ll git better’=I think that she will get better.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></li>

<li class="list">‘Ah aim ’at he’s a better talker ’an t’ parson’=I think
that he is a better speaker than the parson.</li>

<li class="list">‘He’s aiming t’ wrang road’=He’s going in the wrong
direction.</li>

<li class="list">‘Ah aim ’at it’s <em>good</em> eneeaf ti deea’=I think that it is easy
enough to do.</li></ul>

<p>The word ‘good’=‘easy,’ also ‘considerable.’</p>

<ul><li class="list">‘Ther war a good lot o’ sheep an’ a goodish few pigs,’ i.e.
There were a considerable number of sheep, and equally
so of pigs.</li></ul>

<p>‘Good’ also=‘well.’</p>


<ul>
<li class="list">‘Thoo mud ez good cum ti morn ez t’ daay eftther’=You
may as well come in the morning as the day after.</li></ul>


<p>‘To lap up a thing’ is ‘to conclude,’ ‘finish,’ ‘overcome.’</p>

<ul><li class="list">‘Ah s’all lap it up iv a minit’=I shall be done in a minute.</li>

<li class="list">‘Ah’ll seean lap yon job up’=I will soon end that affair.</li>

<li class="list">‘If Ah caan’t lap yon chap up, Ah’ll gi’e ower’=If I cannot
overcome (thrash) yon man, I will give over; literally, I will
admit my incapacity to do anything.</li>
</ul>


<p>‘To gi’e ower’=‘to cease.’</p>

<ul>
<li class="list">‘Noo, bairns! gi’e ower potching steeans at t’ ducks; ya’ll
be laamin’ sum on ’em, an’ then sum on ya’ll be gitting ta’en
afoor yer betters’=Now, children, cease throwing stones at
the ducks; you will be hurting some of them, and then some
of you will be getting taken before your betters.</li></ul>

<p>‘To be taken’ or ‘having to appear before one’s
betters’=‘appearing before the justices.’</p>

<p>‘Bunch’ and ‘punch’ are two words over which
mistakes are often made. ‘Bunch’ is to kick with
the foot or knee, ‘punch’ is to hit with the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<ul><li class="list">‘He bunched, an’ Ah punched, an’ wa baith toupled inti t’
beck tigither.’</li>

<li class="list">‘Mrs. Ridge, will ya mak your Sally gi’e ower? sha’s
bunching ma.’</li>

<li class="list">‘Nobbut when thoo lugs (my hair), Ah deean’t bunch
nobbut when thoo lugs, an’ ivvery tahm ’at thoo lugs, Ah’ll
bunch. If it’s gahin to be lug foor bunch, it s’all be bunch
foor lug,’ shouted Sally.</li></ul>

<p>The very common occurrence of changing the past
participle passive into the infinitive active, with ‘be,’
is somewhat curious. Instead of saying, ‘it will have
to be seen to,’ we should say, ‘it’ll be ti leeak teea’; or,
‘the dog is dead, it will have to be buried,’ would
become, ‘t’ dog’s deead, it’ll be ti sahd by.’ ‘To sahd
by’ is ‘to bury,’ and ‘to put out of the road’ is ‘to
kill.’ ‘Wa’ve ’ed ti put t’ au’d meer oot o’ t’ road.’</p>

<p>As the following bit of information introduces
many of our idioms, I will give it as uttered.</p>

<p>‘Thoo maunt <em>let on</em> aboot it, bud oor Tom’s
<em>keeping company</em> wi’ Hannah, Mary’s lass; <em>an’ Ah’ll

(2) punishment—‘Tho’ll drop in for ’t when ta gans
yam,’ i.e. you will either be thrashed, scolded, or punished
in some form when you go home. ‘Ower an’ up agaan’ is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
a redundancy for ‘many a time’; ‘to neea good,’ of no use,
useless. ‘It’s teea neea good gahin’, ’coz he’s nut at yam’=it

<p>‘<em>Ho’d on a bit</em>, thoo’s nut gahin’ <em>ti rahd rough-shod</em>
ower me.’ ‘Ho’d on a bit,’ spoken in an ordinary
tone, means simply ‘wait,’ ‘stay a moment.’ But in
case of an argument, its utterance conveys the information
that the tongue of one of the disputants
is wagging a little too freely, or it may imply, ‘cease
speaking altogether.’ E.g. I heard a man say the
other day to a fellow workman: ‘Thoo ho’d on
a bit, wa’ve ’ed eneaf o’ thi blather,’ i.e. ‘you cease
speaking (hold your noise), we have had enough of
your silly talk.’ The tone of the ‘thoo’ gave such an
emphasis, that there could be no mistaking the command
which it implied. On the other hand, ‘Here,
Ah saay, ho’d on a bit,’ carries no greater weight
than ‘That will do for the present.’</p>

<p>‘To ride rough-shod over any one’=utterly ignoring
or treating with contempt their desires and wishes.</p>

<p>‘Wa’ve been tul him, an’ wa’ve tell’t him ez plaan ez

<em>gan his awn gate</em>, neea matter what wa sed or did.
Ah tell ya what, chaps—it seeams ti me ez if he
meant ti rahd rough-shod ower t’ lot on uz.’</p>

<ul><li class="list">‘Minsh matters’=not speaking in a straightforward way;
another form of the same expression is, ‘nut ti be ower
neyce,’ not over-nice, careless as to expressions or the
method employed.</li>

<li class="list">To tell a person he may ‘jump up,’ means he may just
do as he likes.</li>

<li class="list">‘To gan one’s awn gate’=going our own way, i.e. acting as we think best.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am certain of one thing—a Yorkshireman, no
matter what his position may be, never quite leaves
his Yorkshire behind him. I was standing one
day waiting for the steamer which was to bring
me once again to old England, when a gentleman
quite close to me said to his lady companion,
‘It’s a beautiful sight, is the sea<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>.’ I turned to
him, and raising my hat, remarked, ‘Ah’s a Yorkshireman
an’ all.’ That was enough, we were friends
the whole of the voyage. No, we Yorkshire people
cannot, if we would, leave our county behind us.
And thank the gods for that.</p>

<small>SIMILES, PROVERBS, AND SAYINGS</small></h2>


<p>The North Riding is very prolific in similes and
quaint sayings. I have by me a collection of some
hundreds, varying in degree of point and humour, but
all worthy of being preserved. Many of them take
us back to the time of our grandfathers, speaking of
things and pointing to customs of other days. Still,
they hang on the lips of the older people now; but to
those who know nothing of their past, their sayings
seem pointless and out of place. Nevertheless, ‘Ez
useless ez damp tunder’ (tinder) would be as forceful
in their day as our saying, ‘As useless as a damp
match.’ In the days when many a pulpit was supplied
with an hourglass—like a huge egg-boiler—to let the
preacher know when to wind up his ‘thirdly,’ the
old saying applied to those who were somewhat
importunate, ‘They hint ez plaan ez t’ hoorglass,’
and ‘Sha’s leyke t’ hoorglass—sha uses t’ same thing
ower an’ up agaan,’ or ‘Sha’s ez careful ez a sandglass,’
which never wastes a grain, were in their day
as pointed as any in use at the present time. A few
remarks to elucidate the meaning of those in the
following list which may be somewhat obscure to any
lacking knowledge on certain points, will be found on
page 243.</p>

<div class="sml">

<p>No. 6. <em>As friendly as a bramble bush.</em> The way in which
the bramble catches hold and clings to one is well known to
all those who have had to force a passage where they grow.</p>

<p>7. <em>As walsh as pump-water</em>, or containing as little sustenance.</p>

<p>9. <em>As thick as inkle-weavers.</em> In the weaving of inkle, a kind
of tape, the weavers had to sit quite close together.</p>

<p>14. <em>As common as a door-sneck.</em> This implies that a sneck
is liable to be pressed or used by any one; the simile is
one of an opprobrious nature.</p>

<p>30. <em>As soft-hearted as a weasel</em>, implies absolute cruelty, the
weasel lacking the smallest spark of generosity in its nature.</p>

<p>31. <em>As slape as a greasy pole.</em> It is common at village
feasts to erect a pole daubed thickly with grease, upon
the top of which a ham, a leg of mutton, or a kettle is fixed;
he who can climb to the top, which is a most difficult task,
claims the prize.</p>

<p>47. <em>As femmur as a musweb.</em> ‘Femmur’ is slight, light,
slender. ‘Musweb,’ a spider’s web.</p>

<p>49. <em>As polite as the devil.</em> His Satanic majesty is said
to be willing to shake hands with any one.</p>

<p>67. <em>As tight as a damp clothes-line.</em> A clothes-line, when
left out in wet weather, becomes very tightly stretched
between its two hooks.</p>

<p>70. <em>As fond as a gate.</em> The folly of a gate is admitted
on all hands; does it not without any reason bang itself
against the gate-post?</p>

<p>90. <em>As plain as a pike-staff</em>; and 91, <em>As plain as a gate-post</em>,
denote both plainness of appearance, and a thing
not difficult to understand. A pike-staff was just a bare
pole, and a gate-post is usually lacking of all ornamentation;
and both are fairly conspicuous objects.</p>

<p>100. <em>As good-natured as a pump.</em> A pump never grumbles,
no matter how often or by whom it is handled.</p>

<p>105. <em>As mean as birdlime.</em> It deceives those who rest
upon it.</p>

<p>108. <em>As deep as a well.</em> ‘Deep’ is used in the sense of
‘to hide from,’ ‘to be difficult to get at the bottom of.’ In
a modified sense, ‘cunning.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>113. <em>Ez sartin ez t’ thorn-bush.</em> It was the custom for
the parson to collect the tithe by placing a branch of thorn
in every tenth stook, he choosing the stooks, and sending
his cart along for them.</p>

<p>114. <em>As waffly as a mill-sail.</em> ‘Waffly’ here implies ‘unstable’;
the mill-sail is turned about by every wind which
blows.</p>

<p>136. <em>As strong as a teagle chain.</em> These chains are used to
drag very heavy timber.</p>

<p>137. <em>As tough as a swipple.</em> The swipple is the short bar
of the flail, used to thresh corn with—by hand—and was
always made of the toughest wood.</p>

<p>139. <em>As warm as a sheep-net.</em> Used derisively; there is
no shelter or warmth in a sheep-net.</p>

<p>140. <em>As catching as the scab.</em> The scab is a very infectious
disease which sheep are liable to.</p>

<p>141. <em>As bonny as a sheep-cade.</em> The cade is a disgusting
looking sheep-louse; hence the simile is used ironically.</p>

<p>143. <em>As busy as a cobbler’s Monday.</em> It is generally supposed
that a cobbler has to rest over Monday to work off
his week’s-end debauch; hence the simile is one of ridicule.</p>

<p>152. <em>As nice as an otter.</em> ‘Nice,’ in this case, means dainty,
particular, eating as it does only the very best part of the
fish it kills, leaving the rest untouched on the bank.</p>

<p>153. See 152.</p>

<p>155. <em>As sweet as a churn.</em> A churn, of all things, must be
sweet and clean; hence anything which may be truly said
to be as sweet as a churn, must excel in cleanliness.</p>

<p>156. <em>As greedy as a fox in a hen-roost.</em> The fox, having
gained an entrance, not only kills the bird he intends to
carry away for food, but any he can lay hold of; then,
picking out the best, leaves the rest.</p>

<p>157. <em>Ez meean ez a cat wiv a moose.</em> ‘Mean’ is used in the
sense of cruel. The way a cat plays with its victim before
killing it, is the very essence of cruelty.</p>

<p>163. A bath-brick must be scraped each time it is used.
Hence a person who has slipped down an incline, and so
become bruised, will use the simile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>164. <em>As badly used as a peggy-tub bottom.</em> Surely whilst
in use nothing receives more thumps than the bottom of
the peggy-tub.</p>

<p>165. <em>As game as a cockroach.</em> No insect perhaps is so
pugnacious as the common roach or black clock. The
encounters which take place on our hearths after we have
retired to rest are many and deadly.</p>

<p>169. <em>As dead as a red lobster.</em> As the lobster must be
boiled for some time before assuming the red colour, we
may with some certainty conclude the crustacean has ceased
to exist ere it dons its red jacket.</p></div>

<p>If many of the sayings which fall from the lips of
our country folk were only dressed in classic language,
they would rank amongst the wisest saws ever uttered.</p>

<p>Take a few illustrations picked from a considerable
number which I have jotted down as they have
been uttered—I may say the circumstances which
called each forth were as varied as they well could be.
Some, I have little doubt, were impromptu, but in the
main they belong to another age. It will perhaps
add interest if the illustrations are given as uttered,
followed by a literal translation, adding explanatory
remarks when needful.</p>

<div class="sml">

<p><em>A raffle tung an’ a race-hoss gan t’ faster t’ leeter wight tha
hug.</em> A foolish tongue and a race-horse go the faster the
lighter weight they carry; there will be more foolish talk,
the lighter the weight of brains carried.</p>

<p><em>Them ’at grumm’ls sae mich aboot what tha ’evn’t gitten, are
maistly oot o’ love wi’ t’ things ’at tha ’ev.</em> Those who grumble
so much about what they do not possess, are mostly out of
love with the things they have.</p>

<p><em>Them ’at nivver diz nowt thersens, awlus ’magines ’at ther’s
nowt i’ t’ wo’lld ’at’s hard ti deea.</em> Those who never do
nothing (anything) themselves, always imagine that there
is nothing in the world which is hard to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p><em>Him ’at’s gitten his heead screwed on t’ reet road i’ larl matters,
weean’t be leykly ti shut yah e’e when he’s owt gert on hand.</em> He
who has his head screwed on the right way in little matters,
will not be likely to close one eye when he has anything
great on the way.</p>

<p><em>Impatience is t’ hoss fau’k saddle and gallop on ti meet their
troubles.</em> Impatience is the horse people saddle and gallop on
to meet their troubles.</p>

<p><em>It’s easier wark feighting sin ’an nursin’ ‘t.</em> It is easier
work fighting sin than nursing it.</p>

<p><em>Religion is offens mair laamed byv those whau attend tul ’t,
’an them ’at feight shy on ’t.</em> Religion is often more injured by
those who profess, than by those who are careless. There is
another: ‘No sinners are so intolerant as those just turned
saints.’</p>

<p><em>Yan awlus ’ez ti paay a seet mair foor repentance ’an yan c’u’d
‘ bowt a vast o’ common sense wi’.</em> One always has to
pay a great deal more for repentance than one could have
bought a great amount of common sense with.</p></div>

Closed lips and open eyes save one from many a quarrel

<p><em>Advising yan ’at’s iv a passion’s dafter ’an scrattin’ a tup
head.</em> Advising one that is in a passion is sillier than
scratching a tup’s head, i.e. giving advice to one who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
in a passion, is equal in folly to that of scratching a tup
on the head, as there is no surer way of inducing it to
attack you than by following such a course.</p>

<p><em>Him ’at’s meead up his mahnd ’at he caan’t deea a thing,
maistly maks up his mahnd afoorhand ’at he weean’t try.</em> He
that has made up his mind that he cannot accomplish an
undertaking, mostly makes up his mind beforehand that he
will not try.</p>

<p><em>Maist fau’k can see t’ wrang they’ve deean, bud nut t’ wrang

done, but not the wrong they are doing.</p>

<p><em>Varra off’ns when a chap sez ’at he’s deeaing nowt, he’s
deeaing summat he s’u’dn’t; an’ when he aims ti mak ya think
’at he’s deeaing summat ’at he s’u’d, he’s off’ns deeaing nowt.</em>
Very often when a person says that he is doing nothing,
he is doing something that he should not; and when he
tries to make you believe he is doing something that
he should, he is often idling his time away.</p>

<p><em>Daftness nivver builds owght wo’th leaving up.</em> Daftness
never builds anything worth leaving up. ‘Leaving up’
means ‘allowing it to stand.’ The saying might be put this
way: folly never accomplishes anything worthy of being
handed on to posterity.</p>

<p><em>Fame is a lump ov nowt putten insahd ov a bubble, which
bo’sts, an’ it’s all owered wiv it.</em> Fame is a lump of nothing
put inside a bubble, which bursts, and then it is all over
with it. To ‘be overed with a thing,’ is for it to be absolutely
annihilated.</p>

<p><em>Good luck gi’es ti sum mair ’an what tha owt ti ’ev, bud nivver
mair ’an what tha want.</em> Good luck gives to some more than
what they ought to have, but never more than what they want.</p>

<p><em>Cussing an’ low-lived talk ther’s nivver neea call for; ther’s
nowt can hap it up, an’ ther’s nowt gitten byv it.</em> Cursing and
low-lived talk there is never no need for; there is nothing
can cover it up, and there is nothing got by it.</p>

<p><em>Him ’at diz ez he owt ti deea when young, ’ll be yabble ti deea

does as he ought to do when young, will be able to do as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
wants to do when his working days are over, i.e. he who
diligently works when young, will be enabled to take his
ease when old age overtakes him.</p>

<p><em>Them ’at weds wheer they deean’t love, maistly love wheer

<p><em>Be friendly wi’ all, bud familiar wi’ few.</em></p>

<p><em>It saves neea end o’ loss if ya sleck t’ fire wi’ yah bucket o’
watter. Luke t’ weeds afoor tha seed; an’ let t’ tap-reeat o’ folly
gan ez deep ez it leykes.</em> It saves no end of harm if you put
out the fire with one bucket of water. Pull up the weeds
before they seed; and allow the tap-root of folly to go as
deep as it may. A fire cannot have done much damage
if it can be quenched with one bucket of water. ‘Luke’ is
‘to pull up.’ Many methods are adopted to prevent the
tap-root from growing deep into the ground; should such
precautions not be taken, the root descends to where the
ground is cold, and no fruit is borne. Hence the reason for
desiring the ‘tap-root of folly’ to be allowed to grow deep
into the ground.</p>

<p><em>Good behav’o’r nivver needs a drain-pipe</em>; also, <em>good behav’o’r

<p><em>He’s nobbut hauf rocked ’at believes ivverything, bud he’s

<p><em>Laziness ruins mair lasses ’an love, fancying thersens mair

love, vanity more than laziness; and believing all that men
flatteringly say, more than both put together.</p>

<p><em>Him ’at ’ez larl an’ could mannish wi’ less, is better off ’an
him ’at ’ez mich an’ caan’t mak it fet.</em> He that has little and
could manage with less, is better off—richer—than he who
has much and cannot make it serve.</p>

<p><em>Nivver judge a blade byv t’ heft.</em> Never judge a blade or
knife by the handle; or, never judge a person’s character by
his clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p><em>Ya’ll ’a’e t’ crack t’ shells afoor ya can coont t’ kon’ls.</em> You
will have to crack the shells before you can count the
kernels; or, you must do your work before you can count
your wages.</p>

<p><em>Sho’t ez yan’s tahm is, it’s lang eneeaf foor sum ti ruin ther

ruin their characters, their constitutions, and ’gan thruff,’
i.e. spend, all they had to commence with.</p>

<p><em>T’ furrows o’ repentance are ploughed i’ youth, and sow’d wi’
t’ seeds o’ pleasure, bud t’ harvest ’ez ti be reaped wiv a blunt
sickle when yan’s back is bent an’ yan’s gitten past wark.</em>
The furrows of repentance are ploughed during youth, and
sowed with the seeds of pleasure, but the harvest has to be
cut with a blunt sickle and gathered in when old age has
made it impossible to repair the errors of youth.</p>

<p><em>Fooak ’at feight ower t’ reet road ti heaven, off’ns finnd oot ’at
t’ far end ’at they’ve deean t’ maist o’ ther jo’ney i’ t’ hedge boddums.</em>
People who quarrel over creeds and forms discover,
when life is drawing to a close, that often they have
foolishly left the narrow but sure path, to stumble and
struggle amongst the thorns and briars which overhang
the ditch by the wayside.</p>

<p><em>T’ loodist shooters i’ t’ fair off’ns ’ez bud larl o’ ther stalls.</em>
The loudest criers in the fair often have the least on their
stalls; i.e. those who make the most noise in the world
generally display the least common sense.</p>

<p><em>Muschief is a fruit ’at nobbut needs a sho’t summer ti repen ’t</em>,
i.e. Mischief speedily comes to a head.</p>

<p><em>Ti stop lennin’, start borrerin’</em>, i.e. To prevent borrowers
coming to you, try to borrow from them.</p>

<p><em>It’s better ’at fau’k s’u’d laugh at ya foor knowing larl aboot
owt, ’an ya s’u’d loss yer brass byv pretending ti knaw owermich.</em>
It is better that people should laugh at your knowing
little about anything, than you should lose your money
by pretending to know too much.</p>

<p><em>When hooap dees, fear’s born.</em> When hope dies, fear is
born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p><em>Yan’s nivver afeeard o’ stepping oot o’ t’ waay ti deea a good

afraid of stepping out of the way to do a kindness, if one is in
the right way for doing it; i.e. we are never unwilling to
step out of our way to do a kindness, if we are sufficiently
Christian to do what is right.</p></div>

<p>Since quite a boy I have jotted down any apt
saying which I have heard. Many such, however, are
so common, that they daily pass the lips of our
country folk. These characteristic Yorkshire sayings,
as already shown, are worthy of greater consideration
than they have hitherto obtained. Why, I once
heard an old Basedale man give a temperance lecture
in a few words; he put the whole thing into a nutshell.
What he said was terse, brief, full of sound
common sense, and decidedly smart. <em>We took it all
away with us.</em> And just because it was what it was,
we never forgot it—we never wished to forget it—whilst
often we have no desire to remember the
one-sided, long-winded, intemperate drivel we have
to listen to nowadays. Said he, ‘Drink, if nobbut
weel followed up, awlus diz yan o’ tweea things. If
ya ’a’e gitten plenty o’ brass, it’ll kill ya; if nut, it’ll
beggar ya’; i.e. drink, if only well followed up,
always does one of two things. If you have plenty
of money, it will kill you; if not, it will beggar you.</p>

<p>‘Some fau’k knaw better ’an ti swing on ther awn
yat,’ was said of one, who was an inveterate borrower
of certain articles, which it was supposed he well could
afford to buy for himself.</p>

<p>‘Sha nivver will larn ’at yan s’u’dn’t hug tweea
eggs i’ yah han’,’ was said of one who generally spoilt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
what she was doing by having too many irons in the
fire at one time.</p>

<p>‘Neeabody tries if a trap’s kittle wi’ ther finger.’
The application is obvious.</p>

<p>To one who was in the habit of returning at a late
hour from the weekly market, and sometimes not
quite sober, it was remarked, ‘Late yam fra t’ market
off’n spoils a good bargain,’ implying that that
which had been gained by the day’s bargaining had
been foolishly spent in the public-house.</p>

<p>‘He’s yan o’ them ’at nivver hauf diz owt, bud
then Ah’ve notished ’at them ’at leeavs t’ hoos deear
oppen, maistly foorgit ti steck t’ yat.’</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Mair kindness, less lip,</div>
  <div class="verse">Mair corn, less whip,’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>might well be hung up in every stable to-day, for
certainly if our poor dumb servants were treated
a little more kindly, they would need less shouting
and bawling at, and when properly fed, the whip
becomes but an ornament.</p>

<p>‘Onny shufflin’ taal diz ti shak off a needy relation,
bud it dizn’t mak ’t reet foor ’em ti squander brass
ti greease thersens wi’,’ said an old body who had
asked assistance from a well-to-do sister, but who
had been sent empty away with a most frivolous
excuse. It seems her sister had shortly afterwards
given a handsome donation at the laying of a foundation-stone
upon which her name had been carved.
‘Shufflin’ taal’ is equal to ’half a lie,’ or, to put it in
a milder form, ‘a poor excuse.’ ‘To shak off’ is
’to refuse’; and ’to grease yersen’ is ’to please<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
oneself,’ ‘to satisfy one’s vanity.’ The saying might
be put this way: ‘By the rich, any poor excuse is
considered good enough to refuse help to a needy
relation, but it is never just, whilst such are in want,
to spend money in tickling their own vanity.’</p>

<p>‘T’ week ’ez tweea Mundaays foor t’ hoss ’at ligs
ower Sundaay,’ implies that a Sunday’s rest gives
greater energy.</p>

<p>‘Nivver tackle what ya caan’t deea, bud allus deea
what ya tackle,’ is certainly an aphorism we should
all do well to mark; the caution and advice which
it contains, if acted upon, spells success in golden
characters. ‘Do not undertake anything beyond
either your capabilities or resources, but whatever
you once set your hand to, carry it through.’</p>

<p>At a funeral feast where one individual was rather
too ready in handing the cake and wine round, one
old body was overheard to say, ‘He mebbe wadn’t
‘ been seea riddy wi’ t’ plate an’ bottle ’ed he been
iv his awn hoos, bud it maistly happens ’at them
’at’s seea free wiv uther fau’k’s hay, are varra skinny
wi’ ther awn corn.’ That many people are exceedingly
generous in dispensing the charity of others,
and very careful in parting with anything of their
own, is a fact too patent to dispute.</p>

<p>‘T’ chap ’at fishes for his breccus off’ns ’ez ti wait
foor his dinner,’ and ‘A blinnd chap owt nivver ti
lake wiv a crab whahl it’s boil’d,’ point their own moral.</p>

<p>At Great Ayton two neighbours were discussing
one who had not long been a resident. ‘Sha’s gitten
a pianer noo, an’ it’s nobbut t’ other daay ’at sha
bowt hersen new shades’ (blinds) ‘foor ivvery windther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
i’ t’ hoos. Wheer sha gits t’ brass ti pay foor all t’ new-fengl’d

sticks paid foor afoor they’re fetched in, is comfortabler
’an yan filled wi’ flee-by-neet stuff;’ i.e. furniture, &amp;c.,
got together at odd times and in odd ways, and paid
for at the time, affords more comfort than possessing
a houseful of things which possibly will have to be
removed during the night to escape the landlord.</p>

<p>‘T’ yard’s weel swept wiv a lent bizzum;’ or, one
does not fail to get the most out of any article which
another has lent us. The following doggerel gives
a phase of human nature common to all mankind:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Yan nivver thinks ’at t’ egg’s new laid</div>
  <div class="verse">Yan’s nahbor kindly lent yan,</div>
  <div class="verse">An’ t’ cream fra borr’ed milk is thin—</div>
  <div class="verse">Deean’t len’, if you’d content yan.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘Sha allus drives ivverything whahl t’ last bat.
Ya caan’t insense it intiv her ’at them ’at git ther
traps tigither iv a hugger-mugger, allus foorgits t’
main thing ’at tha’ll want.’ This is a truism the
world over. If we leave our packing to the last
moment, we shall probably discover the very thing
we mostly need has been left behind. Equally apt
was the saying of one discussing a doubtful proceeding
of some comrade: ‘He’ll deea ’t whahl they catch
him. It’s a mistak at onny tahm ti sneeaf t’ cann’l
ti cleease ti t’ wick.’ It is a mistake to snuff the
candle too close to the wick, for in so doing you may
extinguish the light; i.e. it is unwise to tempt
Providence.</p>

<p>‘They’ve baith pulled yah road; he’s raxed an’
wrought, an’ sha’s scratted an’ tew’d; what yan thowt
t’ other did, whahl i’ t’ end tha want foor nowt.
Bud a breet shool an’ a well-worn thimm’l allus
mak a menseful hoos,’ ‘Raxed’ and ‘wrought’ are
synonymous of working hard, and to ‘scrat and tew’
is to be careful and ever toiling. ‘What one thought
the other did’ only strengthens the opening statement
that ‘they both pulled one way.’ To ‘want for nothing’
is to possess all one needs; and ‘a bright shovel and
a well-worn thimble’ clearly show that neither are
allowed a lengthy rest.</p>

<p>‘It taks mair ti keep a pack o’ hounds ’an t’ damage

explanation is needless.</p>

<p>The Yorkshireman is not one who believes in luck.
Hard work, toil from early morn till night, is the
daily lot of thousands. ‘Luck!’ said one; ‘ther is
neea sike thing ez luck; what cums ti yan, ’ez ti be
fetched. Good luck’s t’ best gitten at wiv a wet
sark,’ i.e. with a shirt wet with perspiration through
working hard. But hard work, if not applied in
a proper and sensible manner, will result in failure:
brute force is not everything. ‘T’ thickness gans for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
nowt if t’ roape isn’t lang eneeaf;’ i.e. the strength
of a rope goes for nothing if it is too short.</p>

<p>Can better advice be given than is couched in the
old saying of ‘Deean’t saay nowt on t’ deearstan at’ll
rax ya ti preeave ower t’ thresho’d’? It is only one
stride from the doorstep over the threshold, therefore
it will be wise at all times to say nothing which will
cause you infinite trouble to prove immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p>The old saying, ‘Buckles borrow, brussen tag-holes
beg,’ clearly points that our fore-elders had a pretty
correct notion of human nature in their day. The short
saying embodies much. If the status of those who
needed assistance was such that they could afford to
wear nice buckles on their shoes, such obtained help
under the head of borrowing; but of those whose lace-holes
were burst, and buckles altogether wanting, it
was said they begged. Appearance goes a long way
towards giving a name to our actions.</p>

<p>Again, ‘Pull t’ bobbin wi’ joy, bud knock wi’
sorrow,’ and ‘Ill news is shooted ti t’ reeaks, bud
good news is whispered ti snahls<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>,’ both tell the same
story. In olden days a bobbin, attached by a string
to the sneck within, hung outside every door. The
saying urges us to haste with all speed to pull the
bobbin and enter if we have good news, but with
sorrow we are to be careful as to how we make it
known. Again, an evil report, it would seem, has
ever been urged on its hurtful career. The rook is a bird
which is not only noisy, but flies far afield, whilst, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
every one knows, the snail is silent and slow; but the
truth of the old saying that ‘Evil news is shouted to
the rooks, whilst good tidings is only whispered to
the snails,’ is, we fear, as true to-day as when first
uttered ages ago.</p>

<p>I will close this chapter with a few truisms, which
fail to be hidden in the doggerel:—</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>CHILDREN‘S LORE</small></h2>


<p>The North Riding is peculiarly rich in children’s
lore. I remember when a lad it was considered
unlucky to hold a third place whilst crossing a stream.
To overcome the difficulty, two would walk abreast,
rather than cross last as third boy. A boy was
not considered a true grammarian<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> until he had
been subjected to the orthodox rule of bumping; and
any boy appearing in a new garment had to submit
to ’nips for new,’ each one giving him a nip to
‘handsel’ the new garment. I remember, too, it was
considered unlucky to write one’s name in a new
book with a borrowed pen. And whilst any one had
hold of wood, and cried ‘Queenie,’ or wet his finger,
calling out ‘I’m wet,’ such for the time being was
secure from receiving the last tig (bat or touch) on
parting for the night—a most desirable point of vantage
to gain in those days. But, be it remembered, this
last tig had to be given on the skin, not on the jacket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
or the boy would call out, ‘I wasn’t born with my
clothes on.’</p>

<p>To possess a white ally-taw was considered most
lucky, a considerable number of marbles always being
offered in exchange, though it was only dire poverty
which would render such a transaction possible.
One hears the same words and terms used now
which thirty years ago came so glibly from our own
lips, and how long before that, goodness knows;
but old men tell us that they played the same
games with the same terms and laws which govern
them now. I remember seeing the look of astonishment
which came into a South-country man’s face as
some boys rushed out of school to their usual ground,
shouting at the top of their voices, ‘Bags Ah fuggy,
bags Ah seggy, thoddy thoddy’; and from another,
‘Fowrt! fowrt! fowrt!’ whilst a small scrap of a
mortal yelled at the top of his voice, ‘An’ Ah bags
laggy, Ah bags laggy.’ Then it was demanded,
‘What’s t’ steeak?’ ‘Tweea a go,’ was the response,
after which the game commenced, only to be followed
by such expressions as—‘Backs neea flies;’ ‘Ah bags
brush;’ ‘Ah sed neea brush;’ ‘Noo, then, neea
fullocking;’ ‘Here, thoo’ll ’a’e ti gan ower agaan,
thoo ramm’d.’ And then up crept a bully of a boy,
who screamed ‘Brulley,’ snatching every taw out
of the ring and running off with them. And really,
after all, one need not be very much surprised if
a southern visitor does fail to understand what the
boys are talking about. But then our lads would be
equally at sea, and find it just as difficult to understand
such a sentence as the following:—‘Oi’ll ketch yer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
one on yer blooming bouko, if yer deoun’t ’old yer
bally reow.’ One is north, the other south, that is
all—at least, nearly all.</p>

<p>For what untold ages our children’s methods of
counting-out have existed, it would be difficult to
say. Some owe their birth to the times of the
Reformation, when with a truly Christian spirit all
things Romish were consistently or otherwise jeered
at<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>; others to still earlier days, and a few to times
remote. Take as an example the following:—‘Ena,
tena, tethra, pethra, pimps; sarfra, larfra, ofra, dofra,
dix; ena dix, tena dix, tethra dix, pethra dix, bumpit;
ena bumpit, tena bumpit, tethra bumpit, pethra bumpit,
sigit—you’re out.’ Again it is repeated till another
is out, and so on until only two remain, and then the
last one is counted out.</p>

<p>The above is not very common, but still it lives;
it is perhaps one of the oldest methods which has
survived. Doubtless, during the centuries through
which it has lived, as might be expected, many of the
words have lost their original sound. It would seem
to date from those days when a mixed race had for
some time lived peaceably together, if ever such a
thing did happen. The children know it, and that
is all. Let us take the first ten words; I will leave
my readers to form their own conclusions.</p>

<p>The comparative study of children’s lore proves,
perhaps more conclusively than that of anything
else, how local circumstances in all things compel
both alteration and modification. Our American
cousins have retained with commendable accuracy
most of the lore belonging to the old country; but as
in some cases the nasal twang has altered the sound
of words, so local and national peculiarities have
influenced and modified them in others; it must,
however, be admitted not to any vital extent. As
an example of what I mean, take the following.</p>

<p>There is a very common girls’ game not only
in the North Riding, but in most parts of England,
called ‘Jennie o’ Jones.’ It is a singing game. One
verse runs:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Red is for the soldiers,</div>
  <div class="verse">For soldiers, for soldiers;</div>
  <div class="verse">Red is for the soldiers,</div>
  <div class="verse">And that will never do.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>
<p>Now, the American soldiers are not dressed in red
coats, but some years ago their firemen were; this
fact enabled the American girls (God bless ’em!) to
shape the song so as to meet their case. So, without
any other alteration worth noticing, they sing and
act the song through just the same as our English
bairns, until they come to this verse, and then, from
one end of America to the other, where the Anglo-Saxon
race predominates, they sing—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Red is for the firemen,</div>
  <div class="verse">For firemen, for firemen;</div>
  <div class="verse">Red is for the firemen,</div>
  <div class="verse">And that will never do.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But to return to our counting-out games, some
of which, by-the-way, originally were curses and
anathemas, but as now sung by our children the
original is lost in a meaningless jargon, often being
devoid of rhyme, but always possessing rhythm.
Many such are undoubtedly little else than so much
gibberish, but in a few cases the rhythm is hoary
with age, and possibly in the long past was listened
to with awe and trembling. A very old and widely
spread counting-out rhyme runs as follows:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Eary, ory, hickory, on,</div>
  <div class="verse">Philson, Valson, Dickson, John,</div>
  <div class="verse">Squeaby, Squaby, Irishman,</div>
  <div class="verse">Stiggerum, staggerum, buck<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The above is the North Riding version.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>The American children sing:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">One-ery, two-ery, ickery, Ann,</div>
  <div class="verse">Fillisey, fallisey, Nicholas, Jan;</div>
  <div class="verse">Quiver, quaver, English Knave-a<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>,</div>
  <div class="verse">Stringleum, strangleum, Jericho Buck.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One other:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ena, mena, mina, mo,</div>
  <div class="verse">Catch a beggar by the toe;</div>
  <div class="verse">If he squeals, let him go,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ena, mena, mina, mo.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again notice the difference local circumstances
give. The American children sing:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ana, mana, mina, mo,</div>
  <div class="verse">Catch a nigger by the toe;</div>
  <div class="verse">When he hollers, let him go,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ana, mana, mina, mo.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of children’s games no further notice can be taken,
interesting though they be. To nursery stories, however,
a short space must be devoted.</p>

<p>It is difficult now to discover in many of them any
trace of religion, stories of the gods, or witchcraft,
but the roots from which many of them spring were
in existence thousands of years ago, and flourished in
far-off lands. The similarity these stories bear to the
myths of other countries greatly help in tracing that
connecting link which shows the relationship of one
race to another, when nearly all other landmarks and
finger-posts have vanished<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>.</p>

<p>Admitting the difficulty of assigning to every story
its myth-root, it is easy enough in most cases to see
the moral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Little Crooked Old Woman and the Pig.</span></p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">A little crooked woman had a little crooked broom,</div>
  <div class="verse">She found a crooked sixpence when sweeping her little crooked room.</div>
  <div class="verse">She set her off to market, which was a crooked mile,</div>
  <div class="verse">Along a crooked pathway with a little crooked style;</div>
  <div class="verse">With her little crooked sixpence a little pig she bought,</div>
  <div class="verse">And with a band tied to its crooked leg, her homeward way she sought<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>All went well until she came to the bridge quite
near to her own little cottage, but this the pig refused
to cross. At that moment a stick came by, and
the little old woman called out, ‘Stick, stick, beat
the pig; for the pig won’t go over the bridge, and
I shall never get home to get my old man his supper
ready.’ The stick declined to help her, leaning itself
against the bridge end. Then came by a dog. To it
she cried, ‘Dog, dog, bite the stick; for the stick won’t
beat the pig, the pig won’t go over the bridge, and
I shall never get home to get my old man his supper
ready.’ But the dog refused to do any such thing, sitting
down near by the stick. Just then a bull came
along. ‘Bull, bull,’ she shouted, ’toss the dog; for
the dog won’t bite the stick, and the stick won’t beat
the pig, and the pig won’t go over the bridge, and
I shall never get home to get my old man his supper
ready.’ But the bull refused to give her any help,
placing himself near to the dog. From a butcher’s boy
passing at the moment, she begged assistance, urging
him to kill the bull, telling him how the bull, dog,
and stick had all refused to help her to induce
the pig to cross the bridge, winding up with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
sad assurance, that ’she would never get home to
get her old man his supper ready’; but the lad only
laughed at her, he taking his stand by the side of
the bull, waiting to see how she would manage. Next
came along a horse, which she besought to kick the
boy, as the boy would not kill the bull, and the bull
would not toss the dog, &amp;c.; but still she fared no
better, the horse standing by the side of the boy.
Next a fire sprang up in the hedge bottom; this she
implored to burn the horse, as the horse would not
kick the boy, and the boy would not kill the bull, &amp;c.
The fire, like the rest, refused all help, quietly burning
where it was. Then she begged of the stream to
sleck the fire, as the fire would not burn the horse,
&amp;c.; but the water ran peacefully on, heeding not her
prayers. Then she heard in the distance the sound
of a mighty wind; to this she prayed, ‘O wind,
dry up the brook; the brook won’t sleck the fire, the
fire won’t burn the horse, the horse won’t kick the boy,
the boy won’t kill the bull, the bull won’t toss the dog,
the dog won’t bite the stick, the stick won’t beat the
pig, the pig won’t go over the bridge, and I shall
never get home to get my old man his supper ready.’
Then came a voice amongst the trembling leaves as
the coming wind sighed through them, ‘I will dry up
the brook.’ Then said the brook, ‘Before I’ll be
dried up I’ll quench the fire.’ The fire at once
cried out, ‘Before I’ll be quenched I’ll burn the
horse.’ The horse neighed, ‘I’ll kick the boy before
I’ll be burnt.’ The boy declared, ‘Before I’ll be
kicked I’ll kill the bull.’ The bull said, ‘Before I’ll
be killed I’ll toss the dog.’ The dog declared, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
it would be tossed it would bite the stick. The
stick at once offered to beat the pig, at which resolution
on the stick’s part the pig said, ‘Before I’ll be
beaten I’ll go over the bridge’; and so it did, and
the old woman got home and made her old man
his supper.</p>

<p>It was not until the old lady besought the aid of
Woden, that her petition was granted. Little doubt
can exist that, as told in the north, the approaching
storm-wind represents that god<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>.</p>

<p>The next story, under various garbs, is told to the
little folks in nearly every corner of the earth. The
connexions between the various forms and alterations
(which different local peculiarities have demanded)
are not difficult to trace, as the connecting links are
all there. Possibly its root originated in the far East.
Though our version comes from the Scandinavian
race, they learnt it from some other nation, probably
Germany.</p>

<div class="sml">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">North Riding Version of the Boy and his Wages.</span></p>

<p>A boy once had a very cruel step-mother; so cruel was
she, that the lad determined to run away. In the end he did
so, and hired himself to a farmer. Now when a year had
passed, the kind farmer gave the lad for his wages an ass
which dropped gold. Off home went the boy, driving his ass
in front of him. On coming to a wayside inn, the landlord
asked him why he did not ride such a fine-looking ass.
The lad in reply foolishly told Boniface that his ass was
much too valuable a one to ride; adding, ‘Would you ride
an ass that dropped gold?’ To this the man asked him
to make it drop gold where it stood. The boy wisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
explained that it was only when nature’s call had to be obeyed
that it did so, and quite beyond his power to command it.
Whilst the boy was having refreshment, the ass was
put in the stable, the landlord keeping his eye on it;
before the lad had eaten and rested, evidence was given
that he had spoken nothing but the truth. It happened
the landlord had a very fine ass of his own; this he fetched
from the field, and whilst the lad slept he groomed it,
trimmed its ears and tail, and blacked its hoofs, till in the end
it exactly resembled the gold-dropping one. This he took
away and hid, putting his own ass in its place. The boy never
noticed it was a changeling which he was driving home. On
his arrival he told his step-mother what a treasure he had
brought her. Hearing such good news, she received him
kindly, giving him a supper of fried eggs and bacon. For
three days he was, as she told him, treated like a prince;
but the third morning, instead of his breakfast, she gave
him a worse thrashing than ever, and turned him to the
door, calling him all the names she could lay her tongue to.
He returned to his master, who kindly received him, and on
the completion of his second year’s labour, gave him for his
wages a hamper, which every day, on the command being
given to fill itself, would be found packed with choicest
food, sufficient to feed a large household. Again he stopped
at the inn on his way home; calling for a glass of beer, he
ordered the hamper to fill. On beholding such a wonderful
hamper, the landlord determined to steal that also, so whilst
the lad slept, he took it away, replacing it with one of his
own exactly similar. To the lad’s discomfiture, the fraud
was discovered the moment he returned home. Once again
he was severely beaten and turned adrift. Again his kind
master took him in, and at the end of his third year gave
him a bag containing a thick stick, which on the command
being given, ‘Come out, stick, and bend yourself,’ would
immediately leap out and unmercifully thrash the individual
who at the time was holding the bag. On his way home,
the landlord spied him approaching, and with smiles and
kind words asked him in. ‘And, pray, what does your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
bag contain?’ asked he, as soon as the lad was seated.
‘The most wonderful thing you ever saw,’ said he; ‘but
let me have a good dinner, and then I will show you.’ The
landlord, thinking to have another good haul, served him with
the best of everything, going even so far as to give him a
glass of wine. All impatience, he waited until the repast was
finished. ‘Now,’ said the youth, smacking his lips, as he
swallowed the last bite, ‘stand in the middle of the room and
hold the bag in your hand, and I’ll promise you the biggest
surprise you ever had in your life. That bag is just wonderful.’
Before the lad had finished speaking, the landlord had
taken his place in the middle of the floor, holding the bag in
his hand. ‘Now open it,’ said the boy—which Boniface did.
‘Why,’ said he, in a tone of great disappointment, ‘it is only
a stick.’ ‘Yes,’ replied the boy, ‘but it is a wonderful stick.
Now just watch what it can do;’ and then he shouted, ‘Come
out, stick, and bend yourself.’ Immediately the stick jumped
out of the bag, and bent itself about the back of the landlord
until he howled with pain. Do what he would, go where he
might, the stick leapt after and beat him, till at last, almost
dead, he cried out, ‘Put it in the bag again; I will return thee
thy ass and hamper,’ which he did. On nearing home, the lad
saw his cruel step-mother waiting for him with a thick stick in
her hand. ‘Wait a while,’ he called, ‘until you see what I have
brought you in my bag.’ Thinking it would be wiser to wait,
she laid down her stick, and let him enter. ‘Now, before I
show to you what I have in my bag, give me a good tea; you
can thrash me afterwards quite as well as now,’ said he. After
his tea, he asked the cruel old dame to take hold of the bag
and open it. This she readily did, little dreaming of what was
to follow. Again he shouted, ‘Come out, stick, and bend yourself’;
and for once the old hag knew what a stick laid across
the back meant. She begged, she implored, she promised
she would be good and kind to him, if he would only call
off the stick. At last, when he considered she had been
sufficiently punished, he ordered the stick back into the
bag. And from that day she behaved herself in a decent
manner.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>As has been said, there are many forms of this
story. This one differs slightly from that told in the
West Riding, and considerably from that of other
countries, but one and all contain the same mythological
essentials.</p>

<p>The kind master is the all-ruling God. The ass
is typical of spring, yielding that which gives all good
things. And the hamper undoubtedly represents
the earth, which is full of all things necessary for our
happiness and existence. But there comes a time
when the gods, displeased with our ungratefulness or
other sins, permit evil spirits to either steal or withhold
the good blessings from us; then follows a
chastising of the evil spirits, who are driven away, and
the earth becomes once again plentiful.</p>

<p>The gold-dropping ass, and in some collateral form
the hamper, bag, and stick, are old friends in Eastern
tales, which were told when the world was very young.
Possibly their radicals, if ever discovered, will be
found in some early religious creed.</p>

<p>Perhaps some student will work out the meaning
and application of the following; it is beyond
me. An old servant of ours was taught it by her
grandmother:—</p>

<p>I remember, when this doggerel was repeated, we
all sat round the kitchen fire, the maid sitting by the
table with her hand near the lighted candle; towards
the last few lines her voice would drop, until, on
repeating the last line, it almost became a whisper.
With ears strained, and eyes nearly out of our heads,
we awaited the dramatic <i lang="fr">dénouement</i>, which most of
us well knew; but in those days the excitement never
waned, always the same intensity of feeling was duly
worked up, as she repeated in a hoarse whisper, ‘dead,
dead, dead in<em>deed</em>,’ extinguishing the light, as she
uttered the last syllable with a fearful shriek, whilst
we all yelled in one mighty chorus. Houses in those
days were built, not held together by the tacks in the
carpets and the paper on the wall; such a yell as we
gave would have shaken the ornaments from off every
bracket nailed to the walls of a whole row of modern
blown-together domiciles.</p>

<div class="sml">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Story of the Poor Old Cobbler and the Wicked
Knight.</span></p>

<p>There was once a poor old cobbler had twelve children, all
girls. He was quite broken down with the hard work of
finding food and clothes for them. One night, when he was
working very late, he suddenly heard a laugh, and on
looking up, saw the queerest little man his eyes had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
beheld sitting by the stove door. ‘And who may you be?’ inquired
the cobbler, resting from his work. But the queer
little man did nothing but laugh and shake his head. After
a while, however, he said, ‘I have a bit of news for you.’
‘Good, I hope,’ said the cobbler, waxing a thread. ‘You won’t
think so; there is another daughter going to be added to
your little family,’ chuckled the old chap. On hearing this,
the poor old cobbler fainted; the shock was too much for
him. He had hoped it would be a boy, who would in
time grow up and help him; but a girl! it was too much.
However, when he came to himself, the baby was born,
and sure enough the queer little old man had been right.
It was a sweet babe, and when three years old the wee
thing showed promise of growing up to be a most beautiful
maiden. One day, whilst the little lass was playing about
the shop door, a knight rode by; seeing the child, he was
struck with her marvellous beauty. Never before had he
seen such beauty and shapeliness of limb in one so young.
As he rode along, he consulted his book of fate, for he was a
wicked wizard knight, and discovered the child was fated to
be the bride of his own son. This he determined should not
be. Turning his horse about, he returned to the cobbler’s
shop, and after some conversation offered him a sum of
money, and promised to take the child along with him, adopt
her, and leave her all his wealth. To this the poor old
man agreed, and away rode the knight with the lovely
child in his arms. Now, he dare not kill the child himself,
because the book of fate told him if any one did so before
she had been kissed by the man she would wed, the
same should die that day. So he determined her death
should be an accident. Riding to the banks of the Ouse, he
jumped his horse off the bank, leaving hold of the little lass
as he did so. As they sank beneath the flood, she was
washed away, and the wicked wizard left her to her fate.
Her clothes, however, buoyed her up, and as she floated
along, she heard a voice call her by name, and a queer little
old man, who was fishing, threw his line over her, and
dragged her to shore. Taking her to a cottage near by, he gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
her in charge of the good wife and her husband, begging
them to take great care of her until he came that way again;
placing a large sum of money on the table to pay for her
keep, he departed on his way. So she lived with these
kind people, until she was eighteen. At this time her many
charms of form and face had become the talk amongst
the courtiers at York. To such an extent was her wondrous
beauty famed abroad, that she was even toasted in the
castle. A certain wizard knight, hearing her so extolled,
rode out one day to where she lived. Seeing her standing
by the door, he passed on, and again consulted his book
of fate, and discovered she was the very maiden he had
looked upon as drowned years ago. Turning back, he
offered the good woman a large sum of money if she
would permit the maiden to carry a note to his brother who
lived at Scarborough Castle. The dame said it was too far
for the maiden to walk; however, just then a queer little old
man drove by with an ass yoked to a cart, and offered to
give the maiden a lift most of the way, so she was permitted
to go. When the queer little old man and the maiden rested
for the night, he stole into her bedroom, and removed the
note, which she had pinned within her chemise for security;
so gently was this accomplished, that she never awoke.
He broke the seal and read, ‘Let the bearer see my son,
command him to kiss her, and then cast her into a dungeon,
and let her starve to death.’ ‘I knew,’ muttered the old man.
Returning to the sleeping maiden, he gently pinned within
her chemise another note, with just the same seal on, and
written in exactly the same writing. But written in this
note was a command that the brother should at once marry
his nephew to the bearer. In the morning, when the girl
arose, she found the ass, cart, and little old man had left
very early; however, she was quite near to Scarborough, for
never had an ass trotted like the queer little old man’s had
done. On arriving at the castle, she was speedily married
to the wizard knight’s son, and they were as happy as they
could be. Two months afterwards, the father-in-law came
to stay at the castle. No sooner did he behold the bride,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
than he saw that he had been baulked again, but he held his
peace. Early next day he met his daughter-in-law in a wood:
she had been seeing her husband off on a hawking expedition.
The wicked knight asked her to walk with him along
the shore, and when they came to a lonely place, he told her
she must prepare to die. Plunging his sword into the sand,
he scratched a mark on the beach, telling her that when its
shadow reached that mark, he would draw it from the
sand and run it through her heart. So eloquently did she
plead, and her beauty was so great, that he relented so far
as to offer her her freedom if she would swear to go away
and never see his son again, until she wore upon her
finger the ring which he held in his hand. She swore she
would do as he wished if he would only spare her life. He
then by magic art threw the ring into the very middle of the
sea, where it sank.</p>

<p>Broken-hearted, she left her cruel father-in-law, and wandered
far away, feeling that she would never see her husband
again. For more than a year she travelled from place to
place. At last the poor young wife was engaged as cook
by a great baron’s lady. Some time afterwards her father-in-law
and her husband came to stay at the castle. The very
day they arrived, the queer little old man and his cart drew
up at the servants’ door, offering fish for sale. The cook
purchased a large turbot, and on opening it, she found inside
it the very ring which her wicked father-in-law had thrown
into the middle of the sea. She cooked the dinner so well,
that the guests begged to see the cook; to this end she
dressed herself in her best gown, put the ring on her finger,
and appeared before them. The wicked knight recognized
her at once, and rushed forward to slay her with his
uplifted sword. But the delighted husband folded her
in his arms, so that his father must have slain both had
he dared to strike. Freeing herself from her husband’s
loving embrace, she held up her hand. The knight saw the
ring. He then knew she was guarded beyond the reach of
any machinations of his; so he gave them his blessing,
and they all lived happily ever afterwards.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>Although in another form the same story is told by
Grimm, and is known to-day in every country in
Europe, originally it was two separate stories, which
have grown into each other. The first part is closely
related to a Swedish and Norwegian story, whilst
the second is from a different root, which is common
to many others. One having a strong resemblance is
that of ‘Mageloné,’ and of mythological signification.
Regarding the story itself, I dare not venture an
opinion. But the guardian spirit, in the form of the
little old man, comes out much more strongly in
the North Riding version than in that of any other.
Again, the act of throwing the ring into the sea,
which was followed by total darkness being cast
over two lives, may be typical of the sun<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> sinking
into the middle of the universe. And the fish
bringing it to light may be symbolical of its rising
again; anyway, the act brought light, life, and hope
for the future. I leave it with you—I have only
suggested, not laid my ideas before you as the
opinion of one able to give an <em>opinion</em> on a question
of this kind.</p>

<p>The story of the ‘Golden Ball’ and others are
common with us; but they must be passed by, as space
only remains for one other.</p>

<div class="sml">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Cruel Step-mother and her Little Daughter.</span></p>

<p>Once upon a time, years and years ago, when animals
possessed the power of speech, a cruel woman lived with
a son of her own, and a little step-daughter of her husban<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>d’s
whom she hated—but then she was a wicked step-mother.
This poor little girl never knew what it was to have a kind
word spoken to her, though she tried in all things to win her
step-mother’s love, but it was a hopeless task. One day she
was sent to the neighbouring village for some candles, her
step-mother giving her a silver piece, telling her to be sure
and bring the change back. On returning home, she had
a stile to climb, and it was such an awkward stile. There
was no other way but to push the candles under the lowest
bar, and then climb over; this she attempted to do, but when
on the topmost rail, a black dog snatched up the candles and
ran off. In great trouble she returned to the grocer’s, and
with some of the remaining money bought another pound
of candles; but this time, when she came to the stile, a white
dog ran away with them. Again she went to the grocer’s,
and found she had just sufficient money left to purchase
a third pound. This time she was wiser, and balanced the
candles on the topmost rail; but just as she did so, a great
black bird swooped down and flew away with them. On her
return home she told her cruel step-mother all that had
happened. Instead of scolding and beating her, she told the
child to come and rest her head on her knee whilst she
combed her hair; and the cruel woman’s heart was filled
with envy and hatred when she saw the wealth of golden
hair which fell about the child, hiding her from view. ‘Your
head tires my knee,’ said she; ‘fetch in the stick-block, and
rest your head upon it whilst I comb out the cotters<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>.’ There
really wasn’t a cotter in her hair, it was only a wicked
excuse. Whilst the child was gone for the wooden block, she
took a sharp axe from its nail and hid it under her apron.
‘Put your head on the block, my dear,’ said she—oh, so
kindly—and the little child, never dreaming what her cruel
step-mother contemplated, laid her head upon the block.
Then the cruel woman brought out the bright sharp axe, and
with one blow severed the head from the body. This
wicked step-mother then tore the child’s heart from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
little breast, put it in a pan, and set it upon the fire to boil,
whilst she buried the body. On the father’s return home,
she said that his daughter was chopping sticks. She then
offered the father some of the broth she had made from his
own dear child’s heart. He tasted it, but said he did not like
the flavour, and would not drink any more; her own son
refused even to taste it. Next evening, when the father
asked for his little daughter, the woman lied again. She
made the excuse that she had sent her with the carrier to
stay with her grandmother, a great way off, declaring that
she would not return for a whole year.</p>

<p>In a short time, on the very spot where she had buried the
child, there sprang up a most wonderful rose-tree, which
bore one large bud; this presently bloomed into a lovely
white rose, when lo! from its petals, there flew forth a little
bird as white as the purest snow. The bird did not stay in
the garden, but flew into the town, and alighting on the
window-sill of a toy-maker, at once commenced to sing more
sweetly than he had ever heard a bird sing before. So
charmed was he that he begged of it to sing again. ‘I
will,’ said the bird, ‘if you will give me the best toy sword
you have,’ which he gladly promised to do. So the bird
sang again, and flew away with the sword to the door of
a watchmaker. Here again it sang: this time it received
a gold watch and chain. With this and the sword it
flew to where some stone-masons were working; to them
it promised to repeat its song if they would tie to its
neck a large round stone which they had just finished
making. This they readily did, and away it flew, alighting
on the chimney of its former home. After resting awhile,
it rattled the stone against the chimney side, which
sounded in the house like thunder. ‘It thunders down
the chimney,’ said the mother; so the little boy thrust his
head under the chimney, to hear better. No sooner had he
done so, than the bird let the sword drop, the leather belt
falling round his neck. ‘See,’ cried the lad, ‘what the
thunder has sent me,’ jumping about with joy. Again the
bird rattled the stone against the brickwork. ‘It thunders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
again,’ said the father, thrusting his head into the chimney,
when round his neck fell a gold chain with a beautiful watch
attached. ‘And see what the thunder has sent me,’ said the
father, removing the chain from his neck, and admiring his
present. A third time the stone was shaken against the
chimney side. Pushing the other two aside, the cruel step-mother
cried, ‘It is my turn this time.’ So saying, she thrust
her head up the chimney, when the bird let the stone ball
drop, which falling on her head crushed her skull, and she
fell back dead on to the kitchen floor. Such was the sad end
of the cruel step-mother.</p></div>

<p>The variety of forms which this story has taken,
and its wide distribution over perhaps the greatest
area of any of our early-life stories, gives it a prominence
and distinction second to none. In many of
the stories of other places, the stone ball is described
as a millstone. Possibly this is nearest to the original,
as in many early fables the millstone figures as
thunder. But to the eminently practical mind of
the Yorkshire folk, it has been discarded, owing
possibly to the unlikelihood of finding a chimney
big enough to admit of its being dropped down.
If its mythological root is somewhat obscure, its
close relationship to other stories hoary with age is
as clear as the noonday sun.</p>

<p>Passing on to other branches of childhood’s lore,
we call to mind the many charms of our youthful
days. Were we stung with a nettle, we at once
searched for a dock-leaf, and rubbing the part stung,
repeated with all due solemnity:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Docken in drahve t’ nettle oot,</div>
  <div class="verse">Just leyke an au’d dishcloot;</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>
<p>or,</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">In docken, oot nettle,</div>
  <div class="verse">Deean’t let t’ warm blood sattle.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The snail-charm is as follows:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Sneeal[80], sneeal, shut oot yer horn,</div>
  <div class="verse">Or Ah’ll kill yer feyther an’ muther ti morn;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>or,</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Snahl<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>, snahl, cum oot o’ yer shell,</div>
  <div class="verse">Or Ah’ll bray yer flat wiv a wooden mell.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The crow-charm, as sung by the bairns, is:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Craw, craw, flee oot o’ seet,</div>
  <div class="verse">Or else Ah’ll eat yer liver an’ leet.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The rain charm is:—</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Raan, raan, go away,</div>
  <div class="verse">Cum agaan anuther daay;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>or,</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Raan, raan faster,</div>
  <div class="verse">T’ bull’s in t’ pastur.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is curious how spitting has come to play such
a prominent part as it has. In certain games of
catching, a boy may be quite securely caught, so far
as actual grip is concerned; but until he has been
hit three times on the back, and the operation of
spitting over his head duly carried out, the capture
is not fully concluded. Again, when two boys quarrel,
one will be asked if he dare give the other ‘his buff.’
This is a slight blow, struck on any part of the
opponent’s person. Virtually, it is a challenge. Up
to this point, however, the actual fight may or may not
come off. The opponents, if left to themselves, are
still open to arrange matters amicably. But if some
boy hold his finger under the chin of one of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
and ask him ‘if he dare spit over,’ and some lad
make the same demand of the other, and both spit
over, then utter disgrace and obloquy would for ever
cling to the boy who, after the performance of such
a sacred rite, dare refuse to do battle.</p>

<p>What boy does not yet fully believe that a horsehair,
either pushed up the cane or held in the hand,
will split it, so as to render it useless as a means of
correction? And which of us in our younger days
did not accept in full faith the belief that horse-hairs
steeped in water turned to eels. Why, I can well
remember the time that every man jack of us, when
we passed Sharrow Cross, always touched the old
stone and wished, and many a pin have I dropped
into St. Helen’s Well and done the same.</p>

 <div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Rob a Robin,</div>
  <div class="verse">Go a-sobbing,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>so we used to say, and for that reason we never
stole their eggs—that is, we did not actually take them
out of the nest with our fingers. No, to save ourselves
from sobbing, we poked one out with a stick, and then
picked it up—under such conditions, we found it lying
outside. Don’t smile, please. Grown-up people nowadays
round the corners of their consciences in quite
as barefaced a manner, and with fewer qualms.</p>

<p>Other children’s lore must with reluctance be
omitted. May what has been written be acceptable
to them.</p>

two following verses are the sole remains of a much
older rhyme, probably about 1800, and may have
suggested the idea to the author of the above, whose
name is unknown.</p>

Ah let things bahd whahl he cam intiv his supper, an’ Ah’

An’ then Ah ran mah fingers thruff his hair. ‘Neea,’ sez he,

leyke mysen can larn ya hoo easy a suverin can be slithered
awaay by backing up sike consate ez ’ez gitten ho’d o’ ya,
whya, here gans.’ An’ Ah pulled mah pess<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> oot, teeak t’
on’y suverin ’at Ah ’ed, and handed it tiv a chap ez war sitting
byv his sahd; t’ young chap handed him yan an’ all, an’
then Ah lifted t’ card up, an’—oho—— o! Ah nivver war
seea capped iv all mah leyfe—it warn’t it. Ah trimm’l’d an’
dithered fra t’ top ti t’ boddum o’ ma; Ah felt just ez if
mah back war stuffed wiv aspen leeaves.</p>

<p>‘John!’ Ah gasped, ‘it’s a swinn’l, it’s a swinn’l; keep thi
han’ i’ thi pocket, or thoo’ll be lossing t’ ten pund ’at mah
aunt Martha left uz ti buy a bit o’ betterly furniter wi’. An’
deean’t let on ’at thoo ’ez ten pund aboot tha,’ sez Ah, foorgitting
’at Ah war letting ivvery yan on ’em i’ t’ carridge
knaw ’at he’d gitten seea mich on him. Hooivver, Ah
hedn’t neea tahm ti saay owt else, foor just then wa gat ti
Stockton, an’ Ah think ther war a warse hubbleshoe on i’
Stockton Station ’an what ther war i’ Guisborough. ‘Noo,
then!’ sez Ah tiv a gert fat woman ’at cam thrussin’ up agaan
ma, ‘deean’t ya cum shuvvin’ ma aboot i’ that road.’ ‘Noo,
then, Victoria!’ sez sha, ‘what’s t’ matter wi’ thoo?’ ‘Ah’s
nut Victoria!’ sez Ah; an’ leeak ya, Ah deean’t think sha
thowt ’at Ah war. Just ez Ah sed that, ther war anuther
woman stood hersen reet on t’ top o’ mah pet bunion. ‘Oh
deeary ma, missus!’ Ah skriked oot, ‘Ah cannut bahd this,
hooivver, ya’re laaming ma sadly; deea tak yer foot off.’ ‘Noo,
then,’ sez she, ’t’ station isn’t yowrs!’ ‘Neea,’ sez Ah, ‘bud
t’ bunion is.’ An’ wi’ that Ah tell’d John an’ t’ childer
ti follow cleease at t’ back o’ ma, an’ Ah boudly pushed
mah waay oot o’ t’ station. Neea seeaner ’ed wa gitten
ootsahd, ’an Ah seed clagg’d on a wall a gert big bill, w<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>i’
theease we’ds printed on ’t, ‘<span class="smcap lowercase">BEWARE O’ PICKPOCKETS</span>.’ An’
what d’ye think? Ah felt i’ mah pocket, an’ mah pess, eight-an’-six,
an’ mah railway ticket ’ed all geean, geean ez cleean
ez a whistle. Ah didn’t tell John; Ah just sed, ‘Thoo mun
keep thi han’ i’ thi pocket, or else sumbody ’ll be takking t’
ten pund fra tha, if thoo dizn’t mahnd.’ He sez ti ma, ‘Tha
weean’t git nowt oot o’ mah pockets, if tha deea shuv ther
han’s in.’ Ah sez, ‘Thoo dizn’t meean ti saay ’at tha’ve
gitten ’t fra tha alriddy, diz ta?’ ‘Neea,’ sez he, ‘Ah ’evn’t
gitten t’ brass i’ mah pocket—Ah’ve putten ’t i’ mah hat.’ An’
then Ah notished ’at he ’ed his hancutcher tied ower his
hat an’ unner his chin, leeaking foor all t’ wo’lld leyke yan
’at war iv an extremity wi’ t’ teeth wark; bud Ah thowt it
war t’ capitalist idea ’at onnyboddy could ’a’e thowt on. Ah
didn’t saay seea tiv him, acoz if yer praise t’ men tha seean
git past thersens—bud ya knaw that bidoot ma telling ya.
Hooivver, Ah did wish ’at Ah’d putten mah pess i’ mah
bonnet, an’ then Ah s’u’dn’t ’a’e lost it an’ all ’at war iv it.
‘It’ll be t’ best,’ Ah sez, ‘foor uz ti finnd wa waays ti t’ course,
git summat ti eat, see a race, buy t’ furniter, an’ gan yam
ageean.’ Noo, hoo can Ah picter ti tha a race-course? If
yer can ’magine all t’ rackapelts an’ raggamuffins gedered
tigither i’ yah crood, shooting men an’ screeaming women,
wi’ rows o’ carridges filled wi’ lords an’ ladies stuffing
thersens wi’ pies an’ pop, ya can ’ev summat ov a idea what
a race-course is leyke. Whahl wa war stannin’ fair capped
wi’ t’ carryings on, whau s’u’d cum up bud t’ varra seeam
young chap ’at Ah’d lost t’ pund teea i’ t’ carridge. ‘Ah’s
glad ’at Ah’ve tumm’l’d across ya ageean,’ sez he. ‘Mebbe
ya may be,’ sez Ah. ‘Ya see, ya wan t’ pund an’ Ah lost it,
an’ that maks all t’ difference i’ being glad ti see onnybody.’
‘Aye, bud that’s nut it; Ah’ve gitten a gert frien’ o’ yer
muther’s wi’ ma,’ sez he. ‘Oh, indeed,’ sez Ah. ‘An’ whau
may that be?’ ‘This is the gentleman,’ sez he; ‘let ma mak
him knawn ti ya. This is Lord Swin’lton, whau knew yer
muther varra weel.’ ‘Ah didn’t knaw ’at mah muther ivver
war acquainted wiv a lord,’ sez Ah, leeaking t’ chap ower;
bud ther war neea doot aboot his being a lord—Ah seed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
that t’ minit Ah clapped mah een on him. Oh yes, he war
all there—ulster, eye-glass, di’mon’ pin, an’ ivverything.
Ther’s no mistakking a lord when ya see yan, tha’re good
eneeaf ti challenge. ‘This is yer husband?’ sez his lordship,
leeaking at John. ‘Got t’ feeace-ache?’ sez he. ‘Noa,
mah lord,’ sez Ah, ‘it’s nut t’ feeace-ache ’at he’s suffering
fra. It’s leyke this, doan’t yer see, mah lord: mah aunt Martha
left us ten pund ti buy a bit o’ betterly furniter wi’, an’ seea
ez neeabody ’ll finnd oot wheer it is, he’s tied it up iv his
hat, foor safety leyke, ez a body might saay, ez ya may term
it so ti speeak.’</p>

<p>‘An’ a varra good plan an’ all,’ sez he.</p>

<p>Just at that minit t’ young chap whau Ah’d lost t’ pund
teea teeak a fit, an’ fell wiv his han’s roond oor John’s neck,
an’ doon tha baith went tigither, an’ ez tha tumm’l’d on ti t’
grand, Lord Swin’lton swiped oor John’s hat off wiv his
stick, an’ next minit Sairey Jane beald oot, ‘Oha, muther!
Lord Swin’lton’s off wi’ mah feyther’s hat, an’ it’s gitten t’
ten pund in ’t.’ Ah didn’t stop ti think, thoo knaws, bud just
off efter him ez hard ez ivver Ah could gan. Ah heard a man
saay ’at he’d nivver seen a woman leg it leyke what Ah did.
Ah s’u’d ’a’e catch’d him an’ all, bud just when Ah war gahin’
ti click ho’d ov his coat taals, Ah catched mah foot iv a tent-roap,
an’ afoor Ah knew wheer Ah war, Ah war laid wi’ mah
heead iv a box o’ cokernuts. ‘Noo, then,’ shooted t’ man ’at
awn’d ’em, ‘cum oot o’ that. Deean’t ya cum cracking mah
cokernuts, an’ sucking t’ milk oot; ther’s neea free sucks here.’
Ah gat up, an’ Ah let that man ’ev t’ length o’ mah tunge—Lord
Swin’lton ’ed ta’en hissel off by that tahm. Ther war
nowt else for ’t bud ti git wersens heeam ez best wa could.
An’ when Ah’d putten Sairey Jane an’ Jimmy ti bed, Ah sed
tiv oor John, Ah sez, ‘Noo, John, Ah deean’t want ti upbraad
tha—it’s been a sad daay foor uz—bud efter all’s sed an’ deean,
thoo owt ti be asham’d o’ thisel foor ivver letting a woman

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Wensleydale and Swaledale readers will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
find it both interesting and instructive to compare
the above sketch, which is given in the Clevelandic
speech, with the folk-speech as spoken in their own
dale, which to a slight degree in pronunciation
tends toward that of Lancashire in one direction and
to that of Cumberland and Westmoreland in the
other. The two latter, however, on all counts,
bear a closer relationship to our North Riding
speech than either that of the West Riding or
South Lancashire.</p>

<p>It must always be borne in mind that the dialect
along the north-east coast of Yorkshire approaches
nearer to its original source than that of any other,
and especially so may this be said of Cleveland.</p>

<p>Mr. Fossick, of Carthorpe, kindly gave me the above
(and several others). He tells me it was sung when
his grandfather was a boy. As Mr. Fossick was born
in the early years of this century, I am not in the
least antedating it. Though turned eighty, the last
time I saw Mr. Fossick, for two hours he recited
poetry without having to halt for a single word. It
is in a great measure owing to the wonderful memories
possessed by our old people that I have been able to
collect the matter for this work.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>A FEW SIMPLE HINTS ON THE GRAMMAR OF THE
FOLK-SPEECH</small></h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Article.</span></p>

<p>There is no variation in the usage of the indefinite
article, save that it still retains its place before
participles and the adjectives <em>few</em>, <em>many</em>, and <em>great
many</em>.</p>

<div class="sml">

<p>Ex.—‘He started a calling o’ ma, an’ Ah started a genning
at him, an’ then wa set ti wark a lethering yan anuther,’</p></div>

<p>Educated people do not nowadays say, ‘I sat
a sipping of my tea, and a smiling at the kettle a
singing on the hob,’ No, it sounds quaint. And to
those who know as little of their Shakespeare as they
do of their Bibles, such speech is put down to
ignorance, or a lack of education, when in point of
fact they are listening to an echo of that old-time
speech which was in full swing long before their great
grandmothers were born, and used by really quite
respectable people; e.g.—</p>


<ul><li>‘As he was yet <i>a</i> coming’ (Luke ix. 42).</li>

<li>‘I go <i>a</i> fishing’ (John xxi. 3).</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></li>

<li>‘While the ark was <i>a</i> preparing’ (1 Pet. iii. 20).</li>

<li>‘His greatness is yet <i>a</i> ripening’ (<i>Henry VIII</i>).</li>

<li>‘There is some ill <i>a</i> brewing towards my rest’ (<i>Merchant
of Venice</i>, Act ii. Sc. 5).</li>
</ul>

<p>In such cases, however, ‘a’ cannot be parsed as an
article. Many opinions have been given, but perhaps
Cobbett, who holds it to be an abbreviation for ‘at,’
meaning ‘without doubt,’ has gained the most supporters.
In the <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 86, we find, ‘Socrates’
disciples burst out <em>a</em> laughing,’ and in No. 420, ‘The
spirits which set the springs <em>a</em> going.’ Such are by
no means archaic forms of speech in the North
Riding, ‘bud ez common ez pigs <em>a</em> grunting at yan
anuther.’</p>

<p>The definite article, as mentioned elsewhere, is ‘t’.’
To this rule there are very few exceptions. Before
certain letters it is almost inaudible; nevertheless, it
is always there. It may be said, and with truth, that
a perfect mastery of the definite article, both in
speaking and hearing it spoken, has advanced those
desirous of knowing something of our folk-speech—rather
more than half of their journey. I know many
people who are fluent speakers of the dialect, but
who read it, even when in printed form, with the
greatest difficulty; others who can read fairly well,
but so far as understanding the dialect when spoken,
might as well listen to a batch of Chocktaw Indians,
as two or three good old Yorkshire dames when
fairly letting out.</p>

<p>A Frenchman once said to me, ‘I could understand
you English people, if you did not speak so quickly.’
Aye, just so, and so would many another body from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
other counties understand a great deal of what our
country folk say if each word was uttered separately,
but with us, as in standard English, very frequently
no pause is made between commas; so the difficulty
increases tenfold, when a stranger strives to follow
a fairly classical dalesman or woman. Take, for
instance, a few words which the other day I heard
a woman shout across a village street to her daughter.
Firstly, as they sounded when uttered, then the same
as they would be written, and thirdly, the translation.</p>

<p><i>As spoken.</i> Teggattenlaadsitwinner.</p>

<p><i>As written.</i> T’ egg at t’ ‘en laad’s i’ t’ winner<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>.</p>

<p><i>Standard English.</i> The egg (that) the hen laid is
in the window.</p>


<p class="gramm"><span class="smcap">Number.</span></p>

<p>This, with only a few exceptions, follows the
ordinary rule of grammar.</p>


<p class="gramm"><span class="smcap">Case.</span></p>

<p>The possessive case is noted elsewhere.</p>


<p class="gramm"><span class="smcap">Gender.</span></p>

<p>The same as in standard English, with this slight
deviation: many things which are neuter are spoken
of as being of the feminine gender. Ex.—‘Sha’s
a fine stack;’ ‘Sha’s a bit rough ti-daay,’ speaking
of the sea; ‘Sha’s gitten a fine bole on her,’ speaking
of an oak. There can be no rule given for guidance,
because in a compound sentence the same noun is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
sometimes both feminine and neuter. A man speaking
of his watch said, ‘It’s yan ov t’ best ’at Ah ivver
’ed; sha’s a good un,’ i.e. ‘It is one of the best that
I ever had; she is a good one.’</p>


<p class="gramm"><span class="smcap">Adjectives.</span></p>

<p>Adjectives which in standard English are compared
by the addition of <em>more</em> and <em>most</em> to the positive,
generally form their degrees of comparison by the
addition of <em>er</em> or <em>r</em> for the comparative, and <em>ist</em> or <em>st</em>
for the superlative; e.g.—</p>

as ‘mair okkader’ or ‘t’ maist okkadist,’ and the like,
with other adjectives, it is also not uncommon for
the adjective to be used as an adverb, as ‘It’s easy

<p>There is no rule to guide the student in the
use of <em>thoo</em>, <em>tha</em>, <em>ta</em>. In a general way <em>ta</em> follows an
auxiliary verb, and <em>thoo</em>, used in the accusative case,
is definite in its application. ‘He’s shooting o’
thoo,’ and ’he’s shooting o’ tha,’ have a well-marked
distinction of meaning. ‘He’s shooting o’ thoo’
implies that the person told of the fact is the actual
person being shouted of; not only does it point him
out from amongst many, but the fact that <em>thoo</em> was
used further implies that the shouting had better be
attended to at once. ‘He’s shooting o’ tha,’ is
merely certain information given, making known to
some other person that he was being called for
without regard to others.</p>

<p>Observe <em>is</em> and <em>be</em> generally take the place of
<em>are</em> and <em>am</em>. In fact, the latter word is very rarely
heard amongst the country people. ‘Are you Tom?’
in the folk-speech, would be, ‘Is ta Tom?’—the
answer would not be ‘Ah am!’ but ‘Ah is!’</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> ‘Is ta gahin’ wiv uz<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>?’ i.e. ‘Are you going
with me?’</p>

<p><i>A.</i> ‘Neea, Ah’s nut,’ or ‘Neea, Ah isn’t,’ i.e. ‘No,
I is not’ (I am not).</p>

<p><i>Nobbut</i>, as a sign of the conditional mood, is quite
as general as <i>if</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> ‘Will ta cum?’ Will you come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> ‘Nobbut it be owt leyke, an’ nobbut I git
deean;’ i. e. ‘If it be anything like’ (as to weather),
‘and if only I finish my work.’</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to hear the future tense used
for the present, and in many instances the country
people, as it were, confuse the perfect tense and
perfect participle. ‘Ah’ve chose t’ whip ’at Ah want.’
‘I have chosen the whip I want (<i>or</i> like).’</p>

<p>‘’Ez ta broke t’ winder?’ would be asked in a
whisper, but ‘Aye, he’s brokken ’t,’ would certainly
be the form in which it would be shouted to the
other boys. ‘Ah’ve spoke tiv him mair ’an yance,’
would be the form such a declaration would take
from one confiding to another the hopelessness of
making any further entreaties; but ‘Ah’ve spokken
tiv him ower an’ up agaan,’ would be the language
used when temper was in the ascendent. Nevertheless,
those who would consider vulgar such sentences
as have been given, are apt to forget that the
accepted rules which govern the speech of to-day
are only correct because they are of to-day. The
rules which were once accepted may have been laid
aside in favour of others; but the country people
move slowly—their speech is that of their grandparents,
and it is what they have been used to all
their lives. They know nothing of the new order
of things. And again, they keep very good company.</p>

<p>Examples:—</p>

<div class="sml">

<p class="center">‘I have already <em>chose</em> my officer.’</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Othello</i>, Act i. Sc. 1.
</p>

<p>‘Methought this staff, mine office badge in court, was
<i>broke</i> in twain.’—<cite>Henry VI, Part II</cite>, Act i. Sc. 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p class="center">‘By what yourself too late have <i>spoke</i> and done.’</p>

<p class="right"><cite>King Lear</cite>, Act i. Sc. 4.</p>

<p class="center">‘Why was this <i>forbid</i>?’—<i>Paradise Lost</i>, Bk. ix. 703.</p>
</div>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Waiting desirous her return, had wove</div>
<div class="verse">Of choicest flowers a garland.’</div>
<div class="verse indent20"><i>Paradise Lost</i>, Bk. ix. 839.</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>Steele, in the <cite>Spectator</cite> (No. 344), has, ‘I have
<i>wrote</i> to you three or four times.’ And he is generally
acknowledged to have been a fairly good scholar,
but then his writings go back a hundred years, and
they spoke differently then. Our people speak very
much like it now.</p>

<p>The formation of the perfect and of the participle
vary considerably from that of ordinary grammar.
As a rule the past participle is formed by the addition
of <i>en</i>. There are other striking peculiarities in the
vowel changes. A list of some of the leading ones
is here given.</p>

<p>Some of those generally in use will be found contained
in the following request:—</p>

<div class="sml">

<p class="center"><i>Key.</i></p>

<p>‘Tommy has come, <em>and</em> Jimmy <em>as well</em>. Now, <em>if</em> we cannot
find room for both on them, could you, <em>without</em> inconveniencing
yourself, manage to take Jimmy in? <em>Still, if</em>
you cannot manage to do so for all the time they are here,
can you <em>until</em> the day after to-morrow. They have come
to see Mary, <em>neither</em> of them having seen her <em>since</em> she
went to place—i.e. situation. <em>And rather than</em> they should
have missed seeing her, I would have gone to my aunt
Martha; but I had better stay at home <em>than</em> go there, <em>if</em>
you can manage it anyway. <em>Besides</em>, your little Lizzie
could come <em>and</em> sleep with our Freddy, <em>unless</em> you <em>lay</em>
her on the sofa. I think <em>that</em> would be the best; now,
what do you say?’</p></div>

<p>In reading the key over, it will be found, in
several instances, that a single word does duty for
several. This tendency towards redundancy is very
common, e.g. ‘If so be as how ’at wa cannot,’
simply means ‘If we cannot’; and ‘Besides, thoo
knaws,’ is ’besides.’ Instead of the last word, ‘besides,’
the usage of ‘An’ moreover ’an that’ is very common.</p>

<p>The rule that prepositions govern the objective
case, expressed or understood, the conjunction never,
holds good in the folk-speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span></p>

<p>The conjunctions in italics are very rarely used,
those in brackets commonly taking their place.</p>

<ul><li class="list">‘Ah s’all be theer (an’ all),’ <em>as well</em>.</li>

<li class="list">‘(Bud hooivver) thoo mun cum,’ <em>still</em>.</li>

<li class="list">‘(Wivoot) Ah cum, deean’t start,’ <em>unless</em>.</li>

<li class="list">‘(Ez) stop wiv him, Ah’ll cum,’ <em>rather than</em>.</li>

<li class="list">‘Ah’ve cum (for ti) see Tom,’ <em>in order to</em>.</li>

<li class="list">‘Deean’t leeave t’ hoss (bidoot) he gi’es tha t’ brass,’ <em>unless</em>.</li>

<li class="list">‘Thoo wait (whahl) Ah cum,’ <em>until</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many who consider the folk-speech of
our country people little better than a mixture
of about equal parts of bad grammar and mispronunciation.
Such a notion, I feel sure, can only
have arisen from either a lack of information or undue
haste. From such I would humbly crave a reconsideration
of the case.</p>

<p>I can well understand those who know little of the
various sources through which the standard English
of to-day has come down to us, considering such
words as those contained in the following list as
being vulgar—<em>backerly</em>, <em>balk</em>, <em>belly-wark</em>, <em>botch</em>,
<em>cant</em>, <em>chaamer</em>, <em>clag</em>, <em>cleg</em>, <em>drukken</em>, <em>flacker</em>, <em>flit</em>, <em>fra</em>,
<em>lake</em>, <em>lang</em>, <em>leck</em>, <em>lig</em>, <em>lop</em>, <em>lown</em>, <em>luke</em>, <em>mirk</em>, <em>neeaze</em>,
<em>owerwelt</em>, <em>raun</em>, <em>roke</em>, <em>rud</em>, <em>scraffle</em>, <em>shive</em>, <em>snite</em>, <em>steg</em>,
<em>stob</em>, <em>stower</em>, <em>sump</em>, <em>theeak</em>, <em>thrave</em>, <em>till</em>, &amp;c. Though
some words in the list may be new to the reader, they
are in common usage amongst our people. And
what is much more to their credit, every one of them
were doing duty hundreds of years ago. And as in
many cases the pronunciation is identical with that
of their Danish relations, we have grounds for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
assuming that not only has the word itself been preserved,
but the actual sound in which it was formerly
uttered, though the spelling often differs greatly in
the two countries. Take, as a single example, the
North Riding word ’stower’; the Danish word is
spelt ’staver,’ but the pronunciation is exactly the
same in both countries. Therefore, as Angus says,
if the sound rather than the spelling be taken, the
similarity of the languages will be found to be
much more striking. A few so-called vulgar words
and their respectable relations are given in the
following list.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Scandinavian in this list must be taken in
its widest sense, as including Old Norse, Frisian,
Swedish, and Danish.</p>

<p>This list might have been greatly extended, but the
above suffices for the purpose of proving that many
of the words considered vulgar are simply venerable
through age. If we inquire a little further, we shall
find not only the words, but the form of speech used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
by our people, which so often seems ungrammatical,
is actually that of the best writers of bygone ages.
The fact is, as has been already stated, our vocabulary
and mode of speech is not of to-day, but belongs to
the time of long ago.</p>

<p>From Spenser’s <cite>Faerie Queen</cite> take as examples
the following words and grammatical forms, which
are quite common with us to-day:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">That seemed both shield and plate it would have <i>rived</i>.</div>
  <div class="verse"><i>For to</i> avenge that foul, reproachful shame.</div>
  <div class="verse">To lose long <i>gotten</i> honour with one evil hond.</div>
  <div class="verse">Much greater grief and <i>shamefuller</i> regret.</div>
  <div class="verse">In hope her to attain by <i>hook or crook</i>.</div>
  <div class="verse">To <i>tossen</i> spear and shield.</div>
  <div class="verse"><i>Me leifer</i> were with point of foeman’s spear be dead.</div>
  <div class="verse">... how stout Deborah <i>strake</i>.</div>
  <div class="verse">Inglorious now lies in senseless <i>swownd</i>.</div>
  <div class="verse">But <i>lapped</i> up her silken leaves most <i>chare</i>.</div>
  <div class="verse">Fast <i>bounden</i> hand and foot with cords of wire.</div>
  <div class="verse">But, glancing on the tempered metal, <i>brast</i>.</div>
  <div class="verse">And ever and anon, when none was <i>ware</i>.</div>
  <div class="verse">And from her head oft rent her <i>snarled</i> hair.</div>
</div></div></div>

  <div class="verse">And <i>axeth</i> of the old ways.</div>

<p>Wicliff, 1380:—</p>

<p class="center sml">And he eat <i>honeysoukis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p><em>The Prodigal Sone</em>, 1380:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Tweie sonnes. And the younger of <i>hem</i>.</div>
  <div class="verse">A ryng on his hond, and <i>schoon</i> on his feet.</div>

<p><em>The Parsone’s Tale</em></p>

<p>Tyndale, 1534:—</p>

<div class="sml">

<p>And not long after the younger sonne <i>gaddered</i> all that he

<p>And when he <i>cam</i>.</p>

<p>And <i>axed</i> what these things meant.</p>

<p class="right">
From the Epistle to the Romans.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Also—<i>Geven</i>, <i>goven</i>, <i>moun</i>, <i>quyt</i> (quit = to repay),
<i>stakker trone</i><a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> (throne), and scores of others are quite
common with us.</p>

<p>The following past tenses are given by Angus as
obsolete, and as having been so for long:—<i>fand</i>, <i>flang</i>,
<i>slang</i>, <i>stang</i>, <i>wan</i>, <i>wrang</i>, every one of which are
in frequent use.</p>

<p>In Wicliff’s edition of the Bible we have:—</p>

<div class="sml">

<p>‘The keperis weren <i>afeered</i>.’ ‘And <i>brak</i>.’ ‘The wisdom of
this world <i>fonned</i>.’ ‘Clensed with <i>besyms</i>.’ ‘Mayster Moses
seide if <i>ony</i> man.’ ‘<i>Twey</i> men.’ ‘<i>Ridile</i> as whete,’ ‘Joseph
<i>lappide</i> it’ (St. Matthew). ‘<i>Moun</i> comprehende with alle
seyntis which is <i>breed</i>’ (Eph.). ‘He <i>concitide</i>’ (St. Luke).
‘And <i>telde</i> him’ (Acts). ‘It schal not <i>rewe</i> Him’ (Hebrews).</p></div>

<p>Such words, when uttered by our country people,
are not vulgar, though they may sound odd, but that
is because they are old fashioned and unfamiliar;
and if their utterance has no charm for you, then
it is music you never heard in your youth, and
which your ear can never rightly appreciate. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
that you may see at a glance to what extent the
language has altered, and how the folk-speech has
remained almost stationary during the last three
or four hundred years, let us compare a few of the
commonest North Riding words of to-day with the
standard English of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and
fifteenth centuries.</p>

<h2 id="GLOSSARY">GLOSSARY<br />

<small>OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND NORTH RIDING WORDS</small></h2>

<p class="center"><i>Giving only those daily in use at the present time, 1898, together
with more than 1000 sentences as examples of the dialect.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">For Rare and Obsolete Words, see other Glossaries.</span></p>

<div class="sml">

<p>N.B.—Some words as we pass from east to west of the North
Riding differ slightly in pronunciation; such, when established over
a sufficiently wide area, have been included in the Glossary. It is owing
to this that the spelling of the same word varies throughout the work,
as in all cases the dialect has been given in accordance with the
pronunciation of the locality in which the incident or word uttered
occurred. As a single example, take ‘fau’k,’ which is universal along
the coast; further inland, in the Great Ayton and Stokesley district
‘fau’k’ and ‘fooak’ are equally common, whilst in Wensleydale and
Swaledale ‘fooak’ is only heard.</p></div>

’lie down.’ ‘Noo’ the third, with a different inflection, was understood by the dog to imply,
‘If you do not lie down at once, I shall hit you.’ And ‘Noo’ the fourth clearly denoted, the
dog having laid down, ‘Now, then, we can talk.’ This inflective power throughout the whole

these varying tones, which are the life and soul of the dialect. When used as an interjection,
it is equivalent to ‘How do you do?’</li>

<h2>CONCLUDING REMARKS</h2>


<p>It is a fact, and one worthy of all commendation,
that every Yorkshireman considers the dialect
spoken in the immediate locality wherein he was
reared, as being not only the best, but the purest.
Doubtless in some cases this is quite correct, but
not in all. Contiguity to other counties has a deteriorating
influence, which naturally extends across
both borders, and is sometimes very far-reaching in
its effect. Owing to this and other causes, many of
my readers will find the pronunciation of some words,
as given both in the Glossary and throughout the
work, not quite in tune with the sound in which
they daily hear such words uttered. This difficulty
presented itself at the very commencement of the
work. A rule had to be adopted to obtain something
approaching uniformity and conciseness. To
accomplish this, area has been chosen; i.e. in all
cases in which a word has several pronunciations, those
given in the Glossary and elsewhere, so far as the
writer knows, are the pronunciations most generally
in use throughout the riding. It may be noted, as
we approach the West Riding and South Lancashire,
that the vowel sounds of <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>o</i> have a growing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>tendency to broaden in sound, often becoming <i>u</i>.
This, however, should be carefully guarded against
in writing the dialect of the North Riding<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>, as there
is ample proof that over a very wide area the original
sound of eighty years ago was the same as now used
in Cleveland. These gradual local alterations form
in time what botanists call sports.</p>

<p>Many words in such places are to-day passing
through a transitional stage. E.g. let us compare
a few words as spoken eighty years ago in two
places I well know, viz. Bedale and Great Ayton.
The former is much nearer the West Riding than
the latter, and very forcibly shows the gradual
alteration in pronunciation some words have undergone
since 1800.</p>

<p>The Glossary contains many words common to
other dialects<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>, especially the folk-speech of North
Lincolnshire, Cumberland, Westmoreland, North
Lancashire, and East Anglia.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to note over what a wide area
the dialect of the North Riding is understood and in
the main spoken. As an entertainer, I come in touch
with the country people of many places, and I have
often been surprised at the quickness with which the
various points in my dialect sketches have been seized
by those of other counties. Naturally I am able to
indulge much more freely, both in dialect and idiom,
in some places than in others.</p>

<p>The North and West Riding dialects widely differ
not only as to vocabulary, but in drawl and intonation;
e.g. take the following sentences:—</p>

<div class="sml">

<p><span class="smcap">North Riding.</span> Noo, mun, wheear’s ta gahin’ teea? Ah’s
gahin’ doon t’ toon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">West Riding.</span> Nah, lad, whor’s ta bahn tew? Ah w’ bahn
dahn t’ tahn.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span></p>

<p>Hear each sentence uttered by men of their
respective ridings, and my readers will better understand
my meaning than from pages of written
explanation. There is also another difference. Whilst
many titled people, and members of the best families
in the North and East Ridings, can, when they have
a mind to, speak the dialect fluently, of only a few
of the leading families in the West Riding whom
I have met am I able to say the same thing. There
seems to be a feeling that in some way it would be
<em>infra dig.</em> to admit ability to speak a word of their
own folk-speech.</p>

<p>Referring to the wide area over which the dialect
of the North and East Ridings is spoken, granting
without questioning slight variation in pronunciation,
the addition of new words, and the loss of familiar
ones as we pass along, we find that practically the
same dialect exists amongst the country folk inside
the following rough boundary line. Draw right-lines
commencing at Boston Spa, Lincolnshire, and connecting
the following places, Doncaster, Harrogate,
Lancaster, along the coast-line to Carlisle, thence
to Darlington, Stockton, Middlesborough<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>, and along
the north-east coast. By so doing you wall in what
may be aptly termed, ‘the north-east folk-speech,.’
But far over this imaginary line, in certain directions,
the dialect is understood and appreciated. This is
not surprising when we remember the same races
overran and peopled the whole of the country from
the Wash to the Tyne and thence north-westward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span></p>

<p>They may be easily traced by their place-names—the
by’s, thorpes, cliffs, wicks, dales, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But if we compare the folk-speech of the district
so walled in, with that of the Danes and their kinfolk,
then its Norse origin is seen at a glance. E.g. take
the few following words—scores of the like could have
been given:—</p>

<p>The Danish, Norwegian, Lowland Scotch, and
north-east folk-speech are closely allied. We must
not, however, compare the spelling, but the general
sound of the words. Take the two first lines of the
Danish national song—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Again, take two lines from a poem in Modern
Friesic published in 1834. The centre lines are from
the poem, with the modern North Riding dialect
above and standard English below.</p>

<p>For a list of words common to the English, Dutch,
and Scandinavian languages, see <i>Trans. Phil. Soc.</i>
part i. 1858.</p>

<p>Much that is written and spoken at the present day
is quite over the heads of our country people. Take
the following, from one of our best authors:—‘He who
performs every part of his business in due course
and season, suffers no part of time to escape without
profit. And it is well always to regard the quality
rather than the quantity of your work, and bear in
mind, if you delay till to-morrow what ought to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
done to-day, you overcharge to-morrow with a burden
which belongs not to it,’ Our country folk would
fully grasp the above if put to them something like
the following:—‘Him ’at diz a daay’s wark iv a daay,
dizn’t waste his tahm, an’ mannishes ti git a bit foor
hissel. An’ yan awlus owt ti aim ti deea t’ bit ’at yan
diz deea fo’st-class, mair ’an aiming ti clash thruff a
seet o’ wark onny road; an’ think on, if ya lig o’ yah
sahd whahl ti morn what ya owt ti-deea ti daay, ya
saddle ti morn wiv a boddun ’at it’s neea call ti bear.’</p>

<div class="sml">

<p class="center">Hah am the rose o’ Sharon and the lily o’ the valley.</p></div>

<p>In a work kindly lent me by my friend Dr. Johnson
of Lancaster, and published some years ago for
the Philological Society, the author, quoting from
<cite>Latham on the English Language</cite>, gives the above
as a specimen of North Riding dialect—nay, more, of
Cleveland itself. Surely the writer can never have
spent a day in any part of Cleveland, for the sentence
given contains but twelve words, seven of which are
distinctly not Clevelandic.</p>

<p>The country people, when speaking <em>naturally</em>, rarely
use the aspirate, except as an intensive. Otherwise
they have little use for it. And when ‘H’ is preceded
by the definite article, they do not drop it in the
sense generally understood; the fact is they cannot
well sound it, for this reason—the definite article is
‘t’, ‘the<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>’ being but rarely used. They could not say
‘t’ horse,’ ‘t’ house,’ ‘t’ hamper,’ &amp;c.; with them it is,
‘t’ hoss,’ ‘t’ hoos,’ ‘t’ hamper,’ pronounced ‘toss,’ ‘toos,’
‘tamper.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span></p>

<p>‘The horse is yoked,’ ‘the hamper is in the wagon,’
and ‘the whip is under the wheels,’ as spoken, would
sound to unfamiliar ears as if the speaker had said
‘toss is yoked,’ ‘tamper’s i’ twagon,’ and ‘twip’s unner
tweels.’</p>

<p>The definite article, to those unaccustomed to our
folk-speech, seems to be entirely wanting. Certainly
before <i>b</i>, <i>m</i>, and <i>n</i> it is only very slightly sounded,
and it becomes the merest touch of the tongue
against the palate when preceding words commencing
with <i>d</i> or <i>t</i>. ‘Shut the door, the bacon and the
beans are on the table,’ would sound to a stranger
as though the speaker said, ‘Shut deear, bacon an’
beeans is on table’; the speaker having in reality said,
‘Shut t’ deear, t’ bacon an’ t’ beeans is on t’ table.’</p>

<p>To return, however, to the line from Solomon’s
Song, given as a specimen of Cleveland dialect. Let
us see what the rendering should have been.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
   <div class="verse">Hah am the rose o’ Sharon and the lily o’ the valley.</div>
   <div class="verse">Ah’s t’ roase o’ Sharon an’ t’ lily o’ t’ valley.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The lower line is North Yorkshire and pure Cleveland,
the upper line is said to be so.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that the aspirate is almost unknown—so
it is as a letter, but not as an intensive. The
aspirate, when misplaced by those speaking naturally,
is only used to add greater force. ‘He’s mah henemy
foor hivver,’ leaves no doubt that the injury sustained
is of an unbridgeable character. Such a sentence,
however, holds quite a different place in grammar, too.
‘Hi hallers taike shagar i’ my tea.’ The first example
is Yorkshire intensified, minus any adjectives, the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
‘H’ expressing or suggesting some such feeling as
implacable, and the ‘hever’ meaning for ever and ever.
The latter is the vile and affected speech of the upper
circles of Yorkshire flunkeys and maids, who try to
improve upon their mother tongue. It holds no place
in our folk-speech. It is hateful, and is only indulged
in by those of whom the old people say, ‘When they
start ti knack an’ scrape ther tungs, what they saay’s
nowther nowt na summat,’ i.e. ‘When they begin to
talk affectedly, what they say is neither one thing
nor another.’</p>

<p>There is one other peculiarity which must be noticed—the
possessive case. I should imagine a hundred
years ago its disuse was universal in both ridings. My
reason for so thinking lies in the fact that in any old
books wherein the owners have inscribed their names—and
they usually did (books were valued in those
days)—the names are never written in the possessive
case. It is always ‘Tom Smith book,’ ‘Ann Scott
book.’ Even to-day in many places, when speaking,
the observance of the case is conspicuous by its absence.
E.g. in the Boroughbridge and other districts
they would not say ‘Jack Wilson’s dog bit Smith’s calf,’
and ‘Peggy’s cat flew through Nanny’s window,’ but
‘Jack Wilson dog bit Smith cauf,’ and ‘Peggy cat flew
throw Nanny window.’ Such sentences as ‘Ho’d t’
hoss heead,’ ‘Pull t’ pig lug,’ and ‘Twist t’ coo tail,’
&amp;c., are still universal in both ridings. The instances
in which the possessive is used, and vice versa, are
now about equal in the North Riding. The peculiar
forms of redundancy are many and curious. ‘Ah
nivver at neea tahm sed nowt aboot nowt ti neea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>body,’
simply means, ‘I never said anything to any one.
I think the following example, which I overheard
one Yorkshireman say to another just before the
train moved out of Guisborough station, is the finest
on record. ‘Whya,’ said he, ‘thoo mun saay what
thoo ’ez a mahnd teea, bud think on, thoo knaws,
’at Ah knaw ’at he knaws, ’at thoo knaws ’at Ah
knaw, all aboot ivverything ’at’s ivver been deean
an’ ‘at’s ivver ta’en pleeace.’ I heard a man say
a short time ago, ‘Ah s’ be agate ti git agate ti
set agate Tom fo’st thing ti morn at morn’; i.e.
‘Ah s’ be agate,’ I shall be about; ’ti git agate,’
to commence work; ’ti set agate,’ to set Tom
to work; ‘fo’st thing ti morn at morn,’ first thing
in the morning. Said one to another, ‘Noo Ah’ll
tell ya what, hard eneeaf, he war neean ower-suited
when he fan oot ’at he’d ’ev ti ’ev ’t ower wi’ ma
owther thruff or by. An’ noo when Ah’ve fetched
him up ti t’ scrat, he sez ’at he’s putten t’ dog oot
o’ t’ road; bud Ah’s satisfied o’ yah thing, t’ dog
rave mah britches, an’ Ah s’all leeak ti him ti mak
’em good agaan, foor he ’ez a reet ti owther deea
that or ’livver summat up i’ lieu on’t; bud Ah reckon
nowt o’ what he sez, an’ that’s t’ len’th on ’t.’ i.e.
‘Noo Ah’ll tell ya what,’ now I assure you; ‘hard
eneeaf,’ without doubt; ‘he war neean ower-suited,’
he was not over-pleased; ‘when he fan oot,’ when he
discovered; ‘’at he’d ’ev ti ’ev it ower wi’ ma,’ that
he would have to talk it over with me; ‘owther thruff
or by,’ either one way or the other; ‘an’ noo when
Ah’ve fetched him up ti t’ scrat,’ and now when I
have made him toe the mark; ‘he sez ’at he’s putten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
t’ dog oot o’ t’ road,’ he says that he has killed the
dog; ‘bud Ah’s satisfied o’ yah thing,’ but I am
certain of one thing; ’t’ dog rave mah britches,’ the
dog tore my trousers; ‘an’ Ah s’all leeak ti him ti
mak ’em good agaan,’ and I shall expect him to
replace them; ‘foor he ’ez a reet ti,’ for he ought
to; ‘owther deea that or ’livver summat up,’ either
do that or give something; ‘i’ lieu on ’t,’ in place
of it (them); ‘bud Ah reckon nowt o’ what he sez,’
but I place no confidence in anything he says; ‘an’
that’s t’ len’th on ’t,’ and that is the extent of it.</p>

<p>If the reader masters the abbreviations and elisions
facing page 1, the <i lang="la">pons asinorum</i> will have been
crossed, and the reading of our folk-speech found to
be a thing easy of accomplishment and a delightful
acquisition.</p>

<p>It will be well to remember, when reading aloud,
that a consonant with an elided vowel must be joined
either to the word preceding or following, as ’t’ hoss,’
’t’ hens,’ ‘t’ wax,’ the horse, the hens, the wax, which
would be pronounced ’toss,’ ‘tens,’ ‘twax.’ Again,
‘Sha’s i’ t’ sulks’ would be ’shas it sulks,’ and ‘Oot
wi’ ‘t, put tane ti t’ ither,’ would be rendered as ’oot
wit, put tane ti tither,’ ‘Ah’ve deean noo, t’ ink’s
ommaist dhry i’ mah pen, seea this’ll ’a’e ti be</p>

Some explanation is needed to make this task understandable.
A large basket (probably a wide creel) had a strong
pole thrust through the wicker-work or handles improvised
for the occasion; each end of the pole was then rested upon
some suitable support, leaving the basket free to swing
about a foot from the ground. On each support and near
to the pole a shell or other light object was placed. The
thing to be done would not be easy of accomplishment.
Those contending for the prize had in turn to seat themselves
astride of the pole with both feet inside the basket;
thus seated, and firmly grasping the pole with one hand,
they had to knock off the shell with a stick (which in the
meantime they used to steady themselves with), then turn
round, reseat themselves, knock off the other shell, and
then get out without overbalancing. You try it, but have
something soft to fall upon. It is marvellous how soon it is
the next person’s turn.</p></div>

The garland consisted of two hoops intertwined, decorated with
white paper flowers and ribbons, in the centre of which was a white
glove, often home-made, of paper or fine linen, upon which was
written or worked in some fine stitch the initials or name in full
and age of the deceased. According to locality this garland was
either carried in front of the coffin by one of the deceased’s dearest
companions, or laid upon it. This custom might well have been
retained.</p></div>

hanged had to be left for some days in a special kind of pickle; afterwards
it was dried in the sun, and then parched in the smoke of

fats; with this candle lighted and stuck in the dead man’s hand,
a hypnotic sleep could be cast upon a whole household. Henderson’s

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
